3,Facebook Facepalm,"I have a nex constantly stalking my Facebook and harassing me about my posts. I’ve blocked him but he gets his flying monkeys to help him and I’m gradually blocking them as I find out who they are. Now he seems to be collecting things that I post ready for a court action. 

The two items he seems to think he can roll me for, are pix of our kids (my settings are for my ‘friends’ only and I know them all personally) - and journalistic articles about narcissists written by other people (no mention of his name, usually no comment at all, just the article). 

One of my therapists thinks the narc articles are great because if he presents those in court, it will paint a colourful picture for the judge without me mentioning anything. 

What do you think? Can he get anywhere with these and use them against me? I’d have thought the stalking would reflect poorly on him?

One brilliant aspect of this is that I was able to write to one of the monkeys asking them to stop the creepy stalking and pointing out how exquisitely ironic it is that everyone assumes an article about narcissism must necessarily be about my nex!

6,Unblocking on Social Media?,"Hi everyone, I’ve been in no contact with my ex for just over 5 months now and it’s been a roller coaster. One second I’m doing so well and the next I’m re-living everything over again—good and bad. The last time I spoke with him he was straight up just screaming at me for 2 hours on the phone.. (he was drunk and angry with me for not inviting him to my work Christmas party) and after that I just never responded again. It wasn’t the first outburst he had with me.. and I knew I needed to finally walk away after a year of a relationship I still cannot understand. I haven’t heard from him since the day after that night when he sent me the good ol “I’m sorry for everything” blanket apology and he’s been blocked on FB ever since. My question is: do you leave them blocked on social media or should I unblock him? I almost feel as though having him blocked is causing me to think about him more? His number hasn’t been blocked and he hasn’t tried to contact me but I’m not sure if unblocking on social media will cause any sort of reaction or interest from him. Anyone else feel this way?

8,I keep checking their socials everyday,"Every few hours. Even after work sometimes the first thing I do is check. How do I stop?

I know this is obsessive and does me no good.

I keep thinking I can find proof that he wasn't like that only with me. His new gf sometimes likes posts from her therapist which may be related to him but I don't know cause she still posts him and he puts hearts on her posts and they seem happy.

I just don't want to be the only person he treated that way. She had dismissed me and told me my words mean nothing to her...they've been together almost a year. About 5 months ago when I contacted her she told me she never noticed anything of what I said about him.

But with me he'd started doing those things weeks in.

I feel angry at her for dismissing me when she seems like otherwise a very kind, sweet, sensitive person. It's ironic cause he had told me I was soft and that he needed someone strong and that he would do worse. But then he found someone just as soft as me.

He later always tried to change what he said and said, ""I just meant I need someone experienced. I didn't say soft is a bad thing."" He had literally broke up with me for it and said ""you're soft. You can't handle me."" in a cold, berating way.

22,Still slandering me on social media,"In my previous post I talked about still receiving emails from my abusive ex (29M). Due to ICloud not allowing to block I tried diverting his emails. It does not work. I’ve tried changing my email but I’ve had it so long and everything important is linked to it. I try not to read the emails but sometimes I am weak and can’t resist. My last response to him was if he continues to harass me I would file charges. That was two days ago. 

Yesterday while at Target I get a Facebook notification on my phone. I click on it.  3 years ago a mutual friend had posted a picture of she and I and said how much fun we had that evening. She and I grew apart and are no longer connected but because I was tagged in that photo, I still get alerts. He commented saying I was a horrible cheater who lead him on for 2 years. It’s a 3 year old post and he commented yesterday!
For the record, I never cheated on him. I dated 1 other when we were separated while he slept with 7 women. (This man has a severe hatred of women)

When we got back together in March of this year we were both honest about what we had done while separated. He insists though that I cheated because I had a “meaningful” relationship. This makes zero sense. All the while he had maintained contact with several of the women he had slept with, and even slept with one of them again while we were trying this year.
I’ve had it! I screen shot it and sent it to him and told him this was the last straw and I was turning everything over to the authorities. The multiple, daily emails where he calls me horrible names and tells me he loves me and to come back. The messages to my family and friends. The calls to my employer saying I’m sleeping with my boss. Everything!
Of course he responds begging me not to and “to have mercy on his soul” he is such a weirdo! I’ve read this article[psycho ex](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/why-bad-looks-good/201708/beware-first-date-red-flags-can-look-red-hot) and I am now scared that he will hurt me and/or my child. I’m not responding anymore to him.
This man has been in jail over stalking, the hospital for a mental breakdown and yet that did not scare him enough to stop! 
I can’t talk to anyone about this because sadly this is not the first time I’ve been thru this with him. It is the last time, but I pray it’s the last time because that is what I want, not because he chooses to do something horrible.

I just got out of an incredibly physically and emotionally abusive domestic violence relationship 3 months ago.
I messaged her to warn her about him. From how she messaged me I don’t believe it was fully her and was also him messaging me through her. 
After messaging her she told me she didn’t believe me, that he was lovely to her, treated her kindly and was soooo nice. She later sent another message and said he told her I’m lying, that we hadn’t been together for months before. After that I guessed he was reading our conversation and looking.
She asked if I wanted him back and that’s why I was messaging 
I told her I was just trying to warn her and to have a good rest of her night.

52,Anyone else develop substance abuse problems from their traumatic relationship?,"I come from a long line of alcoholics but I didn't really see that side of myself until I was with him. I remember early in the relationship I was only 19 and I had very little experience even with alcohol. He'd take me to parties and people would just put drinks in my hand, and I found out fast that it calmed down my anxiety and helped me socialize.

Sometimes I didn't want to be there at all, so I learned the right amount of shots to put myself to sleep in the spare room. His family always encouraged me drinking with them even though he hardly drank at all.

He wasn't the kind of abuser who got drunk and hit me. He actually looked down on me for drinking when things got bad. Toward the end of the relationship I would straight up chug liquor to stop my panic attacks. In the months after the relationship ended I drank every single night. On my worst night I took some sleeping pills and I drank straight wine and tequila until I passed out. I poured the rest of my liquor down the drain after that, and I no longer keep bottles of wine or liquor in my house because I don't trust myself.

I wouldn't say I drink a crazy amount now (a year and a half later). I drink more than the average person for sure, but I think my problem is more *why* I drink. I also smoke now and I use both as a means of managing my anxiety.

I feel a lot of shame about it. I remember my ex calling me an alcoholic and calling me gross when he could smell it on my breath. There are so many nights I don't remember and so many parties that I went so hard at it was embarrassing.

I tried to end things the other night. This was upsetting, all break ups are. This has triggered some kind of ""audit"" of my socials. Socials and who I speak to have been a focal point of almost a year of arguments. 

There's a definite trauma bond going on. I know I need help but accessing talk therapy has been hard despite asking for help for a long time. There's a paucity of resources in healthcare here. 

I feel calm, at peace with my decision, I just don't know how to action it. I'm not at risk due to distance, no need to have further contact, they are safe and have access to help. 

This attempt to end things has prompted an 'improvement' in their behaviour but they were the same person who has said and done things I cannot forgive. This feels like part of the manipulating and provoking they have admitted to doing.

I wish I had been stronger a long time ago. Spent the time fixing myself. Let them do the same. Fear, obligation, guilt with a side of anxiety, depression and co-dependency. I don't recognise myself in the mirror, I look tired and haggard. Not the proud and confident woman I was 18mths ago.

However, I am struggling to find stories that I can relate to. I am a strong professional and I think most people I know would be *shocked* that I was in a DV-marriage. I tolerated a lot because I was paying for him to get better, see therapists, psychiatrists, try medications, and I was able to feel semi-safe during this process, since I am the breadwinner. I pay the bills, I own the house, and I knew that if it came down to it, I have a safe place to be and can take care of myself.

My DV was primary emotional abuse and angry outbursts/put downs, but also occasionally physical in the form of grabbing, squeezing, shaking, holding down, and throwing things at me. I was never *hit* or *beat*, in those sense of the words. I am already facing unintentional stigma from his mother (who is supportive of me and meant well), when she said, ""Well at least it wasn't very serious/bad."" - when he was finally arrested and charged for grabbing/squeezing/shaking/slamming, because I wasn't *beat*.

Since then its helped me not want to go back but all the overwhelming feelings of worry and pain just wont go away. Im a full time student and i work a job i have a lot going for me but its all just too much right now.

I find it hard to relate to anyone around me who else is getting out of an abusive relationship in their sophomore year of college.

Im also scared of what hes capable of. Im no contact and i got a new car so he cant find me but knowing he was going to start hitting me has sent me over the edge. 

Typically he comes back 2-3 months after the discard usually the first week of October to be specific. ( probably bc this is my favorite month and he has to ruin it)

There’s been a lot in this relationship.

It’s taken me three months but I’ve got it all together now. I wanted to have had a different job so that he would have no way to find me. But I wasn’t able to get a new job. 

My therapist advised me to leave a goodbye note. She said that a “normal” person would look for me, so I can’t be sure of what lengths he would go to to find me. So that I should leave a note telling him not to look for me and that I’m gone for XYZ reasons.

77,"I don't know if I can do this alone, and am I becoming like my abuser?","I'm not sure if I can do this alone. Parenting kiddos with disabilities can be hard. I took them to the grocery store with a friend of mine. Two carts. One made a scene over not being able to get 6 beanie babies. She was screaming and crying on the floor. And although I didn't threaten her like her dad used to, I said, ""this is why I can't f*cking take them anywhere."" My friend tried to help me, but I snapped at her for dragging my kid away w/ no shoes (she'd taken her shoes off). Her twin, who was in a Caroline cart, had spent hours crying and whining hysterically in the car, but was doing better after eating cheese.   

My husband never let them have any social interaction and never helped me facilitate any, so they are very socially delayed. I'm at my wits end trying to be a good and loving single mom to them, and every time I yell or have the instinct to swat their bum, I feel like I'm a terrible parent. I don't know how to discipline them in a way they understand. Maybe that's why he became so abusive? 

I also found myself snapping at my friend a lot, which i feel so guilty about. My friend raised kids with challenges, as she likes to remind me. Finally, after the third time she said something to that effect in one day, I said, ""you don't have as good a handle on them as you think! I know them, they're my kids, please just listen!""

I heard the words coming out of my mouth, but I felt like they were my abusers words. Things he said to me. I feel like I've become like him, and I hate it so much. My friend took it in stride and said, ""I've been where you are, I get it.""

Most of the time I'm very patient with my daughters, but I don't know how to do this on my own without losing my mind. My mom also spanked me when I was kid, so the instinct to spank when they tantrum (not meltdown, tantrum), is so real and it takes everything in me to fight it and not to scream. Also, it usually takes an hour or more, and for both kids to be being loud for me to get overwhelmed sensory-wise myself. 

I just feel ill equipped, and although I don't actually hit them, and I don't threaten them (or even think to), it makes me wonder if I have a bad seed in me. Am I becoming my abusers?

89,Feeling Dissociative,"Hi everyone 🫣 new here.

I’ve recently gotten back into the dating game after experiencing rape and then an abusive relationship. I had been talking to someone who I developed a crush on for the first time in a while and on our second date he told me he was partnered and poly. I don’t have any issues with people who are poly but at this point in my life, it’s not something I’m interested in exploring. I just want to build a connection with someone I can trust and build a life with. 
Anyway, he was very pushy about continuing see him and I felt uncomfortable but still liked him even though I was feeling pressured…he even told me what I was hoping for (monogamy) wasn’t possible. 
I went to see him tonight, it was planned for a week and we were going to talk. I disclosed why I didn’t feel like I had the emotional capacity to be poly and had doubts about continuing to pursue a relationship with him. I told him my story and when I got to the aftermath of my rape and the period I was dissociative and fell into a relationship with an abusive man (which is very common) he told me it sounded like I was just having fun and that was my choice - my choice to be with an abusive man. I was absolutely triggered by that and told him that upset me, wasn’t fair and was going to leave. He said ok without even looking at me. 
I feel like I did something wrong. Did I? I feel like I should be relieved that I missed another abusive situation but I also feel that awful feeling that maybe he had a point? I’m confused and defeated once again… will I ever be able to trust someone again?

 My ex moved to Southeast Asia last July and he and our kid talk over Facebook/FaceTime a few times a week. 

I haven’t unfriended my ex but also don’t generally  talk about him on social media. I did move him to my “restricted” list so he can’t see what I’m up to unless it’s public. 

He sent a long Messenger message at around 1 this morning (so 10am his time) that he “saw a post” from me proclaiming how “thrilled” I’d be if we unfriended each other. 

I can’t remember saying anything like that at all. He did rant about people taking selfies and how he’d have to unfollow anyone who takes them.

447,Tik Tok took my story but changed the ending and I think it is harmful,"
https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8dD2syG/

So quick recap. I posted in AITAH about my then fiancé that I didn’t want to go through with our wedding as he was extremely frugal to the detriment of my health and savings. 

I was asked to post here because some called what he did financial abuse and while I still struggle with the label abuse I do know his behavior towards me was not healthy.

A commenter forwarded me this and I this ( thank you for that) and this is not okay. They changed the ending to be some kind of fairy tale and the comments under it are all people so happy it worked out. 

I don’t think this is okay. I don’t know what the future holds for me and my now ex. I am still very much looking deep into myself and what I want. Him suddenly turning everything around in two weeks time is insulting. Because if he did that… I would be so pissed off! Because it means he can do it but chose to ignore my pleas so many times. Made me sick because he wouldn’t put the heating up to just flip a switch and change? Because I left ? 

I don’t mind them using my story as content. I do mind them changing the ending and creating unrealistic expectations. If somebody finds themselves in my shoes they might be disappointed when it turns out… wel exactly how it is with me. Slow ,confusing ,painful, hard work, doubt , grief and uncertainty.

451,My trauma story,"In 3 days it will be a year since my fiancées death. My abusive fiancée. I was with him for 5 years. He was the love of my life, and he beat me. He insulted me. He caused a miscarriage because he beat me so hard. But I loved him dearly, he was the moon and the stars and the universe to me. I met him before the drugs, and before the illness took place. He was a college graduate, he wanted to be a mechanic. He was an hard core addict, with psychotic tendencies. In 3 days it will be a year since he blind folded me and drove me a 3 counties away to a shitty hotel, tied me to the bed, pumped me full of drugs and stabbed me 4 times with his favorite pocket knife. I had stab wounds on my stomach, and breast. I pleaded with him, for my life, for our child’s. He told me that an angel had been whispering to him to do this for a few days now.  I was 32 weeks pregnant at the time. He got on his knees and cried and held my hand and told me I had to go to heaven now, and that id be with both my babies. I screamed but no one came out, it was in a bad part of town. He then went into the hotel bathroom, while I laid there bleeding, and got into the tub and slit his wrist. 

After a while I realized he wasn’t coming out, so I screamed and screamed and finally a cleaning lady came by. I was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, and forced into emergency C-section. God must’ve been watching over me, because my baby was born alive. He spent over a month in the NICU, but alive. I catch myself thinking and longing for the life I use to have. Before my fiancée went crazy, before drugs took over his life, before he started beating me. I never anticipated that that day would end so cruelly. Now I have ptsd and see a therapist 4 times a month. I think of him almost everyday though. The old him. The one who brought my favorite smoothie to my work during my lunch break, and took me on our first anniversary to a museum he caught me checking out because I’m a huge nerd. The one who had learned how to braid hair because I couldn’t do it on myself. He taught me how to skate, and how to cook homemade lasagna, and we’d sit on our patio with our paint sets and paint for hours.

I wasnt allowed to talk to my family or friends.

If you were a man I was not allowed to talk to you or i would get punched in the face and strangled... if i didnt say hello to a man ""one of is friends or someone he knew"" then i  was rude and would get punched in the face or strangled.... i was scared and confused.

It got to the point where it was hard for me to use the restroom, for two years after i had escaped this ""relationship"", because if i was in there too long he would accuse me of stealing from his, using drugs, or doing something ""shadey"". i would get attacked beaten and dragged by my hair and throat.

This guy was the devil in disguise.

 I always saw the best in people and thought that i could show them love and loyalty and that they could change for me and learn to trust and love again.... i was wrong.

Now years later i have issues with this monster in my dreams.

i wake up screaming at the top of my lungs in a panic attack..its very scary..just need to vent and let this out somewhere so i came here...i need to let this out.

464,My success story,"It's been longer than a year since I've seen my ex in person. Last time I saw him was when I was 7 months pregnant and holding our 1 year old. He kicked down the front door of our apartment because I wouldn't let him in. His addiction to drugs got so bad and I was trying to do best for the kids. I wasn't even phased by the damage because I was use to it. He has punched me in my head so hard I couldn't see out of my left eye. He has choked me till the point I was left with huge bruises on my throat. Punched me in my jaw and I couldn't eat for days. He even held an axe to my chest when I was pregnant with our first child. Sometimes I really thought he was going to kill me. But for some reason I never left until I was really tired of it.

I packed everything up and moved across the country the next day. I still cry thinking back how I use to let him hurt me like that. I still get anxious laying in bed because he loved to choke me in my sleep. I still doubt myself and put myself down. I am healing and focusing on bringing a brighter future to my kids. I let him FaceTime the kids sometimes but he still has no idea where we live. I'm not ready to tell him and might never. I feel so much lighter not having that fear weighing on my chest.

468,I want to hear your stories if you went through abuse and have found your person,"I went through 5 years of abuse and I'm 2 1/2 years out. March 18th will be 3 years since I left my abuser. I finally found my person. A good man who loves me and I truly love him. He doesn't yell and he doesn't make me feel bad for being me. Quite the opposite. He makes me feel safe and loved. Even when we've argued and he's yelled, I still feel safe. I know he's not going to hurt me. 

He treats me with respect and I feel like I finally found the person I deserved all along. Being with him has made me realize how badly people have treated me my entire life, even my own mother. It's no wonder I ended up in an abusive relationship. He's made me realize that no matter what you go through, there's hope that it will get better. 

If you're still trapped or just not ready to leave, I can tell you that you deserve better and that there is help out there and there's hope for a better life. Please don't believe those things that this person is telling you. You are worthy of love and you are a good person. When they tell you those things, they are projecting themselves on to you.

 Please don't internalize it. I know that it's hard and I'm telling you something that feels impossible but I promise you it does get better. My ex almost had me convinced that I didn't deserve better and here I am almost 3 years later. Sometimes I feel lucky to be alive. I wanted to hear other people's stories who have gone through it and come out the other side stronger and better.

 The man I've been speaking of is the man I am proud to call my husband. I never thought I would find him in a million years and I almost gave up and I'm glad I didn't.

474,My story is not as bad as a lot of the stories here. Is this even abuse?,"For a very long time I have excused everything that he has done. The porn addiction. The drug addiction. The alcoholism. The name-calling. The unreliability. The disrespect. The withholding of affection. The silence and not allowing any communication between us. The rage.

He gets angry and he tells me that he doesn’t love me and that he never did. He gets angry and he tells me that we are done. He tells me to never talk to him again. 

My excuses for why I stay are that he has never hit me, he has never physically hurt me. Sure he has left me more times than I can count or remember. Sure he’s controlling manipulative and gaslights me. He makes me feel worthless, useless and he hasn’t touched me in a loving or kind way in years. I don’t even remember what it feels like to have a real conversation with him or to feel his kiss.

But I am disabled and he is all I have and I am terrified to leave him. Who would ever want a 36-year-old woman with so much baggage? Who would ever love someone with disabilities? And so I stay in this toxic marriage, this marriage that is killing me every Day. How can I ever get out when I do not have the confidence to be able to care for myself?

477,My abuser confessed to a meth addiction but then took it back. Can’t decide what to believe from this story.,"This happened a while back, but to this day I still can’t say for sure if I think he was an addict or not. So what happened was our relationship had hit the worst bad spell so far after three months of his absolute inconsistent behavior, paranoia, and caustic reactions to just about everything. When I broke up with him for good, he told me out of the blue that he has been doing meth for the past few months and that was why he became so abusive. He acted like the drugs were entirely to blame for all of it. Not only that- but I needed to get back with him and help him through this terrible time. I guess he expected my sympathy or support or something, but I was horrified and betrayed and made him leave again after telling me. After seeing my reaction, he tried to text me that he made the whole thing up and he doesn’t do drugs. 

Either scenario is equally disturbing. Either he is a meth user or a chronic manipulative liar, so nothing he said changed my mind about the break up. But I still have no idea if he was using or not. I never found any drug paraphernalia or evidence of it for starters- but he had a history of doing it which makes obvious grounds for a relapse. And also…who on earth would lie about a hard drug addiction for sympathy? I think he only took it back because he saw his plan to get sympathy didn’t work at all. What do you guys think?

478,"Survivor story - life is so good, it gets better. TW violence.","I (23f) started dating my abuser (38m) when i was 18. He was my first boyfriend, i lost my virginity to him, and I was head over heels in love. I thought he was perfect. A couple months in he ""caught"" me smoking weed - he showed up at my house after ignoring all my phone calls, the house reeked of weed and i was literally sitting on my bed naked after a shower. We hadnt been dating long and when he bursted in i tried to cover my naked body, he yanked the blanket off and started spanking me until i was bleeding. I was so caught off guard. I stayed with him for 3 years after this and indured so much abuse. I stayed because I was in love and life can be gray sometimes. I knew that he was making my life unbearable but I couldn't imagine life without him. He was all I had- that was his intention. When i finally left him for good i spent about 3 months crying over him- missing him, wanting him back. But thank god i never went to see him because it would have probably been right back to square one. We did text/call frequently and the truth is sometimes we still do. Weve been broken up for almost 1.5 years now, the past year has been one of the best of my life but i still call him sometimes. I know i shouldnt but i do. I do think a big part of it is wanting him to know how good my life is without him and then also because he was my first and only ""love."" 

I haven't loved anyone since him so far- but i have met some of the most amazing men. They helped change my thought process of ""i hate men"" & ""all men are bad."" I don't hate men any more. I don't hate myself anymore. I just got back from a weekend spent with a new crush - and it has me reflecting on my growth since leaving my ex. I cant believe how good and fun life is these days. I take advantage of every moment - two years ago i was just trying to survive each day, i had lost the perception that life could be beautiful. It was dark and disgusting and now i'm filled to the brim with optimism - doesnt mean im immune to negativity now - but being sad over a crush not texting back is nothing compared to the fear i felt when my ex punched me in the head until I saw stars, took my phone and keys  & said he'd kill me if i walked out the door.",irrelevant,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred
488,Gaslighted over underwear. Share your ridiculous stories.,"Feeling like the crazy one, while logically knowing I can’t be. Was at the store, wanted new underwear because the briefs I own has been rubbing and causing some issues with cysts (a part of me even figured maybe it had something to do with it altogether). I wanted boy shorts. We were on the way to go somewhere and I mentioned wanting to grab some. We’re standing there and he keeps mentioning “here is briefs” I kept repeating (because he was) “I don’t want briefs, I need boy shorts”. He then said they are the same thing, I showed him photos on the packages to show it was not, he repeated, and I said “regardless I want boy shorts”. So I walked over to them and the package of course had a number that you checked the back to see what sizes the number covered. Not a S,M,L labeling system. My husband figured it was a regular number, and said “you don’t know your size? All women’s underwear are the same size number.” I mentioned not everyone does because things can vary greatly and up until now I had only bought from VS or stores with S, M, L, and that he’s not a woman so it’s really not his place. Realizing this was stressful and that we needed to go anyways, I decided we could just leave and I would check another time. He then got upset as we walked away saying I didn’t allow him to disagree, and “had to be right” after I pulled out photos just to nicely show I wasn’t trying to be difficult. I cried a bit in the car telling him zero of my intention was to prove I was right but to just show him I wasn’t kidding and that those briefs specifically I was also trying to stay from to explain why I wouldn’t just buy them, so that he knew I wasn’t just being petty. He insisted that I just want to be right, and that I was ridiculous.

I’m sad because he made major improvements last week more than any other times (he’s had small but never leaps and bounds). The counselor and I are still trying to determine if he’s emotionally abusive only and will choose to change, or if he’s a Narc and can’t. So far he seems to know what he’s doing, but grew up with a Narc dad who abused them. So there is disconnect for him with what’s normal. It’s been rough, no worries for me as in the mean time I developed a plan to leave because while he may or may not have the ability if I need to leave I will. 

But I just feel like he made me feel so crazy for that and it’s just sad and disappointing.",cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
493,Just a story of my very recent ex - this isn’t a normal reaction right?,"

I had a miscarriage last year - I was very tired and drained physically. I noticed that he wasn’t helping around the house as much. I started asking him if he could help here and there and I’d get attitude. I even tried to jokingly bring it up and again get snapped at. One morning he was very pointedly only washing his dishes. I had just made breakfast for us (he made pour over coffee for us each morning and I made all the meals) and asked if he was going to wash anything else. He got MAD. Told me he definitely wouldn’t be doing it now. I texted later asking what was going on with him and his reply was ‘you don’t respect my work from home hours. You always text and ask me to take meat out of the freezer or switch laundry - I’m working!’ 

To be fair I did do that, but I wasn’t demanding it be done NOW I was just asking if he could do it because I’m at my full time 40 hour/week job and I can’t do it. He was at home and he stops working for several hours mid day. I didn’t think it was a big deal, but he made it into this HUGE thing and actually punished (by ignoring my requests for help or being passive aggressive) me for a good month. 

Then when I pointed out that I had just had a miscarriage he cut me off and said ‘don’t you think I’m upset too!?’ - of course he was, but if I had been allowed to finish I could have explained that I was exhausted and still losing blood. I just needed help, THATS all.",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,no,no,,no,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,no,no
494,This is my story. Its killing me.,"I'm 24. I've been in a 5 year relationship with my boyfriend who's 22. At first everything was going alright, I thought everything was dreamy. But I guess I was wrong. He was always speaking with her ex. Her ex called me insane a lot of times, I was just having a bad moment between anxiety and depression (I was just diagnosed with it), and he didn't understand that. He said the same he said I was just plain crazy. It didn't ended there. My sister died and I needed some love. What I got was he saying that he was confused about his feelings. I got crying bad. Later that month he did send me crying after going to the hotel and even yelled me when we lost in a videogame.
I tried going out of the relationship. I did left him and he went after me. He said he wanted to be with me and chased me over my other relationship.
I came back with him.
A few weeks later he goes insane. He tells everyone that I was a cheater and that I hurted him badly. That he did nothing for me to be like that.
Things started to become worse. Literally he would say he didn't care if I ended up dead (I was thinking on suicide a lot of times)
I was recently diagnosed with Borderline. I was weak. He keeps doing that and having me to beg for companion.
He shares Facebook posts to shame me. He yells at me. He's secretly seeing other females because  apparently that's  okay for him to do. He his friends whatever he wants.
The social pressure he has over me is too much and I'm afraid everyone will hate me if I leave him. I don't know what will happen. I'm scared. I'm deeply hurt. I don't know what to do at this point and whenever I try to do something I feel really bad to do it.

507,Abuse survivor sharing my story,"I (27f) was in a relationship with my ex (28m) when we were 17 and 18. After what I thought was a loving relationship quickly turned verbal abusive he construction put me down, accused me of cheating and other things. 

One evening one of our arguments got a little heated, then it stopped I thought that was the end of it but he tried ending my life. The next morning my mum came to get me (as we were living together) after about two weeks of apologies and gifts I went back to him. I know I shouldn't have but I loved him. We started off again like it did at the beginning until I started working, he'd constantly accuse me of cheating, always checked up on me, came in to my place of work to make sure I was working. If I came home late (I was made to walk home even at night) he'd accuse me of cheating. 

Finally one day I had enough and a few months before I was 21 I called my mum and we moved all my stuff out but not within him trying to manipulate me into staying. I ignored him and left but it didn't stop he would constantly turn up to were I was staying, send me gifts, he even invited himself to my 21st birthday meal. After Christmas I was finally fully free of him until one day I had a male friend over someone who gave me the confidence to leave him after being in a similar situation with his ex girlfriend. My ex turned up at the place I was staying and barged his way in and attacked my friend as he thought we were ""sleeping"" together which wasn't true I tried to stop him but I ended up getting thrown into a wall by my ex. The police were involved over the attack but at the time I didn't want to press charges because I was too shaken up. I don't know if my friend did but it was me who mainly got hurt in the process.

The problem is I live less then five minutes away from where he works(exit down), and just found out this month that he now lives off my exit. I am terrified that I will bump into him! 
The first two years, especially after we got married, the abuse was just throwing stuff at me, pushing me, choking me, and punching parts of my body that I could cover up, etc. I left twice but, I went back. It’s so hard to write this! The last year we were together the abuse got so much worse. I was in such a victim mentality, always saying sorry, isolated from friends and family, believing it was his last time, and worse. I even believed that the bruising had to be my immune system, and went to a cancer specialist to get loads of blood work. He cheated on me, and was also very emotionally abusive. In the 4 years of abuse I ended up at institutions 8 times. The last month we were together was mid December and after he didn’t come home for 2 nights we got into an argument. He choked me, and punched me so hard that he not only gave me a concussion but fractured my orbital floor to my cheek. After 2 weeks my family came over and saw my face and made me report him. He ended up going to jail for a few weeks and eventually did 3 months and 15 years probation. I ended up calling the domestic violence hotline and went into my county women’s shelter where they helped me get on my feet. I am in a 3 year program that ends next year so I realistically can’t leave. I am in a very good program that not only helps me with my rent but also monthly advocate meetings and recovery groups so I can talk about my trauma!

525,Sharing my story,"I've recently moved to another state with my abusive boyfriend and am isolated and lonely. I just want someone to talk to, I have no friends, my boyfriend is a disabled veteran who has made great strides in his mental health within the past 2 years I've known him, but still he isn't good to me sometimes. We are pending criminal trial for when he was suicidal and smashed my car, got physical with me but I have no injuries. I got a neighbor to call the police and they arrested him and gave him multiple charges. He says I escalated the situation by screaming and I ""activated his PTSD"".

When he got out of jail, he was so appreciative of me trying to help him, and he has been treating me well ever since. He has really taken his mental health seriously and goes to 4-5 various medical appointments a week. 

It's hard because usually things worse in domestic violence situations but for him, it's a different story. The emotional abuse/constant controlling has lessened since we moved in together. But for the past 24 hours he has refused to talk to me because I said I wasn't going to buy him some sandals & pants he wanted. 

He seems so much happier when he is traveling abroad and I see him as the man of my dreams, he volunteered, studied yoga... but when we traveled together it was like he resented me the entire time and I felt so alone.

It's so sad because the past 2 months have been amazing, he's been so appreciative, level-headed, got on antidepressants. We signed a 1 year lease together and if I broke it, he would be homeless because he is basically unemployable with his disability/PTSD. I make good money so I'd be OK if I left I just don't know if I should give up on him or not.

546,I’m angry at friends and family who did not notice the abuse I endured. Is this something I should be angry about?,"To make a long story short…

I was in an abusive relationship for over a year. It was financially, emotionally and physically abusive. I feel the warning signs were loud and clear. I stopped leaving my house, I isolated myself, I would tell brief stories of bs I was dealing with to loved ones etc..

When I finally left him, I did it all on my own. I didn’t tell anyone what had been going on until it was all over. I only recently began to tell friends and family of that dark time in my life. When I do tell them, they blame me. I did move in with this guy only a month after knowing him, but no one could of ever told me it would be abusive. And I still stand by that. So I think the judgement of it being my fault is unfair.

This blame usually leads me to feel anger because I feel like “how could you not have noticed”. I feel the signs were right there in their face. Yet no one decided to start a conversation with me. No one decided to point out that what I was going through wasn’t right. I was only 20 when I entered the relationship. I was young and naive and looking back I feel it was impossible not to see it.

I’m angry. I’m angry at him, at my friends, at my family. I’m angry at all those who sat back and watched it happen. I’m angry at those who blame me for not leaving or moving in with him. 

Is it normal to feel this way? Should I be angry at them? I want to let them know how angry I am, but I also don’t want to be unreasonable.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
554,Where do I go from here?,"I was abused by my narcissist ex boyfriend 9 years ago. His abuse was mainly psychological, emotional and sexual. It wasn't the countless rapes but the psychological abuse is what has affected me the most, I only truly realised the abuse 2 years ago and I have been in therapy ever since.

I'm doing a lot better now, I cautiously say I'm moving past it all. But I'm struggling with the feeling of being silenced and I want to take back my power. I'm not naive, I know I have practically zero proof of the abuse, only friends who were in my life at the time knowing something was wrong (although they never witnessed it). So I can't come forward legally (my country is very backwards with abuse cases).

I'm thinking of going public with my story, without naming him (definitely not ready for that) I want to share my story in hopes it gives other survivors some courage in speaking about their abuse or even to help people recognise abuse tactics. I know many survivors have made this choice so I'm wondering if it's a good idea? Did you feel better after it?

I know I can't take it back once it's out there so I just want to hear other survivors stories and how it helped (or didn't) help them to help with my decision.",irrelevant,no,yes,no,yes,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
560,Separated 4 months,"Long story short I (22f) have been separated from my (27m) husband for 4 months. I was at a domestic shelter for women, although it was never physical, he threatened me a lot so I left with our one year old. 

Recently he got a job offer for 8 months on the road, and we talked out that I could stay at the house. He said I wasn’t allowed to invite anyone over, and I’m not allowed to go to the gym. Okay whatever. 

Now he is making more demands. And has lifted the veil of his desire to control me once again. Stating -“by law and by heaven, you are bound to me and I am bound to you. Whether you like it or not.”

His text to me right before that statement over the phone-
Do you know what you saying ""I know"" tells me? It tells me you are cocky and full of yourself, which is not how you used to be, that's not my (me) and that's not a true Christian, and now that ""you know"", you are telling me I don't even have
to tell you, you already know, and you think you can do better than me.
That's what it tells me. And if that's how you think, if that's how you feel, we should end this now, before you make things worse than they are.

561,Furniture in divorce hearing,"So, my journey with my abusive ex is just about over.   Started a year and a half ago with me filing a PFA and getting him out of the house that I rent am the only one ever on the lease for.  He drove a car I owned that got repod cause I'm not paying that for him . 

It just got repod like last week.  That's was the only lingering unknown in my mind for filing was also saving up for a lawyer.  

Long story short we both filed on the same day but he beat me to it.  So we have a hearing on zoom both unrepresented.  

He listed the vehicle I own, furniture in the house which he bought none of was all gifts from my family, and ""equity"" in a house neither of us own as the items to discuss asset wise.  Both of the vehicles one now repoed, were bought before we even got married.  When we met he had a mattress on the floor, a coffee table and couch as his only real possessions.  

I'm allowed to submit documents for review to the judges aid in advance.  I am wondering what would you all share?  Would you share any of your abuse?

566,Functional Neurological Disorder caused by Trauma,"I have a history of trauma. My mother has BPD which really messed my brother and I up.

 Hyper-vigilance, emotional dysregulation, addiction, self-harm, anorexia, multiple attempts, multiple hospitalizations, medical  trauma. 

Ive spent the past 5 years getting sober, going to therapy every week, finding meds, going to the hospital voluntarily. I was stable and happy and we were going to start a family this year.

Unfortunately I have endometriosis, and my medical trauma/anxiety continues to worsen. I had a surgery for endometriosis in October that didn't work. I had another one in March with my specialist. That was going to be the start of feeling like a stable, physically healthy adult. 

Instead, I freaked out after the surgery. As soon as I was left alone I started to freak out. I started scratching at my face, ripped my IV out, I couldn't press the button for help because I got so disconnected so quick. I couldn't speak, I could hear them talking about me but couldn't respond. I thankfully connected with one nurse who understood. 

I was in the Labor and Delivery ward. Apparently they have ""never seen this before"". I got my things taken away, a couple of men with guns outside my door, and some Haldol. Lots of it. I refused to let them call my husband. 

Being mentally ill is nothing new to me. But unfortunately I have some significant reactions. Having a history of abuse means I can't let go of control. I can't regulate my emotions,  I feel an intense need to leave my body. I lose my ability to speak. Multiple professionals in a room scares me, people talking about me scares me, being held down scares me. Policies scare me. 

So in addition to the physical trauma of the surgery, my mental breakdown has to be considered.

5 days after my surgery, I started to fall. 
Long story short, I've been in a wheelchair for 5 months now.

The only diagnosis I have at this point is Functional Neurological Disorder. I've had so many tests. I have absolutely 0 stamina. I can't stand for more than 30 seconds. I spend 95% of my time in my wheelchair or on the couch.

 I've lost everything. 

About 85% of me can agree with the FND diagnosis. But I've also ""only"" been disabled for 5 months. My mental health history always trumps anything else. They see anxiety, bpd, anorexia, that's why I'm having issues. I'm the most mentally stable I've ever been.

I was happy. I was going to be healthy. And now I can't walk. 

It's just terrifying that trauma could have caused this. Supposedly I can get better. I'm going to try a FND specialist but that appointment isn't until next year.

It came on overnight and I'm hoping it will go away overnight.",no,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
567,How do you let go majority of your life…?,"I will be 30 soon. I have been through a few households that are were hardly peaceful. Traditional Mexican family who favored the boys and us girls were taught to be seen not heard. I don’t speak to the family anymore. Then there’s my ex family whom I thought were my forever home, but it was a nightmare the entire time. 

The extreme abuse from my ex husband led to a point where I thought I shouldn’t exist in anyone’s life, so that I won’t be a problem anymore. I went through therapy, admitted myself in a mental ward, took medication to save our marriage. (He’s was very aware of his actions but wanted me to take action) His mother raised me since I was 13, and taught me everything I know including military training for my army career. She, too, broke my heart and hoped that I stayed after learning about the abuse. 

I was isolated by the entire family and friends. 

Now, I’m in a safe environment where there are no eggshells. I graduated college and pursuing in my career path. I achieved more things than I ever imagined, all thanks to my fiancé. 

The question is: how do I stop mentioning my biological family and my ex family when it’s my entire life? 

My fiancé and my friends mention about their childhood stories and things about living in a big household. Those few precious memories I have as well, but it feels awkward to mention about the families I no longer talk to.

He abused me emotionally, financially, and worst of all sexually. He downplays what happened and even puts a lot of the blame on me. It's so hard for me to see what's true and what's not. He says we have to set it aside and move forward.

He said we have to, normal people do, healthy couples do. He also insists on sex for the same reasons, even though I'm no where near healed from the trauma of his actions.

879,I’m so done…,"I’m so done with men (or anyone for that matter) trying to justify their abuse. “You triggered me”. “It was just a reaction”. “I was abused as a kid”. If you were so traumatized by your childhood abuse, then why on earth would you want another person to go through something so traumatic as well? Narcissists, controllers, manipulators, abuser etc. will always somehow try to justify the abuse. And then in most cases flip the blame on the victim, “well if you didn’t or hadn’t done *blank*, I wouldn’t of reacted that way”. They gaslight you and drain you of all your positive energy. As someone who knows from experience, we should not have to filter or even hide or not express how we truly feel in order to prevent an outburst or risk upsetting our partner. I was silence during most of my abusive relationship. As I look back at the girl who felt her opinion or feelings were always muted or dismissed, I pity her. I’m some way, I don’t know how to explain it, I don’t regret dating my ex. Now I know that may sound strange but it taught me to never put up with the things I did. I had always had the basic rules of dating for myself like don’t be with someone who puts their hands on you, belittles you, etc. however they love bomb you and once again make excuses and say it will never happen again. In my case the first time he pushed me (he only pushed me 2x before we broke up thank god-however even the thought of pushing your partner is not okay let alone the actual act of doing so) and told me “I didn’t mean to push you that hard”.

1) you should’ve pushed me in the first place (I told him)
2. I can’t recall but I’m not actually sure if he ever said he was sorry that night. 

He ended up calling this off with me.

It’s okay to miss the person you thought they were (the act/mask they put on in the beginning) but you also need to recognize that that person does not exist, it was only a way to lure you in and live bomb you.

ABUSE IS NOT OKAY! THERE IS NO EXCUSE! I’ll say it again for the people on the back, ABUSE IS NOT OKAY! THERE IS NO EXCUSE! And NEVER EVER let someone make you think that the abuse is your fault.

He has always been verbally and mentally abusive but I made excuses. Whenever he didn’t get his way he would pout and become nasty.

908,Scared to talk to him when he is done work,"We were getting along perfectly fine this morning. Then I said the wrong thing.. we were talking about my hair (naturally very dark but it has had varying shades of blonde throughout our relationship) and how I have had dark in my hair while we have been dating, through ombré. 

In September 2016, I was going back to school and couldn’t afford the upkeep of blonde hair, but I knew that my boyfriend really liked it. I asked the hair dresser to put more dark in my hair and blend it with the existing blonde. 

My boyfriend absolutely fucking lost it on me when I said that. He kept saying that it was extremely disrespectful of me to have had dark put back into my hair because I know that he likes it blonde. I remember him telling me that it looked good at the time, but apparently that’s not true. I also remember telling him about the appointment and that my new colour was a surprise, but that isn’t true either I guess. How could I be so disrespectful and rude to him? Please keep in mind that over half of my hair was still blonde, that this was like 2 years ago, and my whole head of hair is blonde now. 

I could not stop crying. I asked him why he is doing this and his reply was “doing what?”. I also asked why he is treating me this way and his reply was “I’m not treating you like anything”. I cried my whole drive to work. 

On my break, I called him. We were getting along ok, but he seemed kind of different. So I asked if he was still angry at me, and he freaked out again saying that he forgot that we fought. I started crying and apologizing for bringing it up and he said “oh no, I’m very glad that you did. I want to remember that and how disrespectful you were”

I cried and told him he had ruined my life and that the way he was treating me was destroying me. I'll admit when he asked me where I was at that time I actually said ""why should I tell you?!"" Which was very childish of me and I shouldn't have done it. I was completely safe by my parent's house. But his demeanour completely changed, he was eerily calm and said ""That's fine, I'm going to call the police on you to do a safe and well check because I think you're mentally unwell."" He repeated it twice in the same eerie voice and I felt sick to my stomach. It was as if he knew full well the impact it might have on me.   

We've never discussed it since, and it was about 8 months ago. But when I mentioned it to him and talked about how the police threat made me feel, he acted as if he had no recollection whatsoever about it. He was asking me about it in an inquisitive way as if I was describing a TV episode to him. I felt confused and frustrated and crazy. This isn't the first time I've tried to talk to him about things he has done and he denies knowledge / memory of them. I feel like I'm making the whole thing up. Or at least it comes across that way. His lack of recollection feels extremely incredibly genuine.

He wanted an unfriendly girlfriend. I didn’t grow up “pretty,” I had a “glow up” so I know what it feels like to have people be unfriendly to you. I strive to be kind to anyone around me. My ex wanted me to be unfriendly and rude to any man around me and it felt so wrong. I was with my ex for 2 years, I ended it 7 months ago. The first year he was quite abusive both verbally and physically. Now that I am out of the relationship, I don’t have many friends and it seems easier to adopt the same mindset of no-opposite sex friends and believe that everyone wants to ruin your relationship so you have to stay guarded.

925,Husband got very angry bc I forgot to tell him I am meeting a friend for brunch after church tomorrow. He has done similar things - forgotten to tell me he is meeting a friend for evening drinks or lunch. I NEVER go out with friends. EVER. I feel so anxious about going. Pls help.,"I have been considering divorce for about the past 9 months and am still in that consideration process. I look for whether there is anything salvageable in my marriage. My husband has made big improvements. But then stuff like this happens and his anger makes me so anxious. 

My title says it all. I mentioned to my husband that I had made brunch plans weeks ago and forgot to mention it earlier - and asked if he would watch the kids for about 2 hours after church so I could go to brunch. He did take them out for several hours today, so I said let’s plan for him to have some time to himself tomorrow afternoon to do whatever he needs/wants to do to make up for the fact that he was so busy with the kids today. I told him I completely understand that it’s upsetting and annoying that I forgot to remind him about the brunch sooner. I mentioned it about a month ago and then forgot to add it to our joint calendar. I also told him that I was surprised that he did not show grace and patience to me, given that this kind of mistake is very rare and given that our “precedent” has been set by my being accommodating with him on the occasions when he has forgotten to tell me he has plans that mean more lone childcare duties for me. Was that manipulative of me to say? I am trying to be stronger and firmer, so I stood my ground here bc if I am not firm he steamrolls me (and did completely for many years; I was way too cooperative). 

He vented to me with such intensity about how upset he was. He said it’s like I just expect him to step in line with what I want. He acts like he resents me. I haven’t been to brunch with friends in over a year. He eventually calmed down and apologised. But I feel so anxious - anxious about his resentment if I go. I wish things could be normal. I have a feeling that other women don’t have to be anxious about this. Are all men like this?

I'm fleeing for the weekend.","I've been posting on here for over a year - but the torment has been happening for over 4 years now. I have suffered every form of abuse from him...physical, mental, verbal, and sexual. It's been absolute hell.

I have opened up to my parents, particularly my mother, since she's been in a similar relationship. They don't know the whole story of course, I probably won't ever tell them the whole story, they don't need that on their hearts. However, they are fully there for me and understand the pain and anguish I'm going through. They want only the best for me.

Tonight, he apparently was going to take me out to dinner. And I forgot, and I already had eaten dinner. He absolutely freaked out and kept me on the phone for over an hour, refusing to let me speak. He just screamed and screamed at me. He said ""I will take you to dinner tomorrow! If you don't we are done! Absolutely nothing! Done forever!"" I just agreed with him to the ""dinner plan"". And simply said ""okay"" to everything he said throughout the rest of the so called conversation.

I immediately called a sibling and said ""can I come to your house for the weekend?"" Now my boyfriend knows of this sibling, but no idea where they live. My sibling said yes of course, you're welcome here for the whole weekend.

So we made the plan. I pretend like everything is normal to the boyfriend, but the sibling picks me up straight from work. We drive an hour or so, then I text the boyfriend telling him I'm done and that I'm gone for the weekend. Then I'm blocking him and leaving it at that. I will not have further contact with him. My parents are staying at home to protect the house and the dogs.

I'm hoping everything goes smoothly. Please, please pray for me. I need all the good words and thoughts. This is so scary, who knows how he is going to react to this.

Even now, he's texting me saying ""i love you so much"", ""you're my whole world, my wife"" and ""I already have our son's name picked out and I've been looking at house to buy"" (note I am NOT pregnant and not one to want kids ever, thank God!)

Trying to fathom the emotional & physical abuse and intimidation knowing I “ deserve way worse” than the treatment he’s giving to me and for what I’ve done to him. I have hurt him but I don’t deserve this much..,"It became a huge tit for tat and now since I’ve tortured him when it comes to support numerous times.  He’s become physical with me. He’s done this more than once. He says for the numerous times I made him miserable I need to get it back. He’s put his hands around my neck he’s clawed into my thigh he’s pushed me down several times,  he’s thrown cash on the floor and asked me to pick it up and then he’s pinched me, he’s pulled my hair back he’s gotten right up in my face told me he’ll punch me and all this is not as bad as what I’ve done to him and that if I’m truly guilty I have to accept this treatment and more. Along with all this, I have to only show him happiness for a year. Like he did for me when he cheated. I’m not allowed to bring anything up, even my sadness that my friends left me and no one says anything to defend me to him. 
I have given him a tough time. I know how hard it’s affected him. When he cheated on me I was making him repent his actions every day. Ruined his med exams and times with friends because I wanted him to console me. I never consciously inflict this on him not intentionally and I’m very careful to not repeat it. If it does happen it’s due to harsh circumstances clouding me. He cannot understand anything and will not because of how often it’s happened. 
But isn’t this a bit too far… 
Worst part is I wish I hated him. I wish I could ruin him and walk away. But I can’t. 
Knowing he’s come from physical and sexual abuse , how can he be okay with inflicting more on someone else.

I’m unable to speak to anyone because of the shame I have for staying and that everyone will look down on me for doing so. None of our mutual friends who I’m very close to want to listen to me.

Please help!,"I had gone to pick up a few things real quick and the parking lot of the store was relatively deserted. I saw a guy yell at his gf/wife, and she was crying.

Once inside, he continued to hit her really hard. By this time, I had called 911, and they said they'll send in officers. 

The officers came in 10 minutes later. They spoke to the girl, I was waiting a little far away so as to not make the guy flee the scene before the cops arrived, so I just waited there, hoping they'd cuff him or something. But she probably told the cops it was all ok. So they left after a while. I tried to run up to catch the cops, to tell them what I saw, and that she wasn't safe. But they accelerated and left the scene before I could catch up.

We were wildly, deeply in love at one point. We were best friends. We grew up together. Yes, thats all true and he says that to me as reasons we should stay together.

I know he felt bad before but he would always make excuses and blame me. Now he sees that he's an idiot because I am walking away.

I just didnt even react when he said all that. It wasn't worth it. I'm so fucking angry and sad. How could he say that to me? Part of me feels so afraid that's true and I'll never find as deep a love again, despite it all. The other part of me feels disgusted because is the bar that low for me? He loves me so much, yet is willing to harm me mentally, physically and sexually? Those aren't acts of love. They're acts of violence. How can you say you love someone like that, but willingly harm them? Nothing makes sense. And yeah, I felt that love from him once upon a time. Then he decided to destroy that with his hands and his words and actions. I'm so so angry. I was supposed to be done! He was meant to be the one I was going to marry, my fairytale of getting together while we were young and building a life together. I hate him for what he's done to me. I hate him for destroying us.

He’s lied and disrespected me so much. From emotional abuse to sexual abuse and cheating with multiple women. The last few days, he’s been blowing up my phone begging to talk to me. Showing up at my apartment and knocking on my door. I had to move my car so he didn’t think I was home.

He showed up at 10pm last night and he knew I was home so I went outside to talk. He just stood there and told me a million lies. Like so many lies not remembering that I already knew the truth. He claims he asked his ex to be his plus one to a wedding when we weren’t talking and blaming me and our instability for it. We’re only unstable because he keeps ending our relationship to run back to her for momentary reunions. Not to mention his female friend that he has reserved his Saturdays for.

I gave him an ultimatum to uninvite his ex to the wedding. Shortly after he called claiming that he did but I just didn’t believe him. He told me to decide if I want to go with him. Right after I said I blocked her he immediately changed his stance and said he’s gonna go alone because he doesn’t like my attitude. We ended the conversation at that and he said to take the week to have some space.

I just can’t deal with this relationship anymore. His behavior isn’t normal and so unhealthy. I texted him today to say that we’re done. Of course he blamed me and said I’m just mad that he told me to “stop stalking the b*tch”. I told him that it’s not about her but his patterns of behavior and he needs to take accountability because this is all his doing. He didn’t reply and I’m going to end it here.

1416,Why do they hate it when they make you cry?,"Sorry- I know this question has probably been asked before. 

So I made the wise decision of leaving my abusive boyfriend- but I am left with the burning question of why in the world do abusers seem to get so angry when they make their victim cry?! 

I’ll admit to crying easily in fights. My father made it a mission when I was a child to break me down and make me sob whoever he got upset with me. I think he enjoyed it. As a result as soon as I begin to feel upset, ashamed or vulnerable I start crying.  And of course in an abusive relationship feeling upset, ashamed or vulnerable… happens quite a lot. 

I just still have trouble comprehending how a partner can be dismissive, belittling or just mean enough to make their significant other cry and then get angrier about it. I’ve been accused of trying to manipulate him when I cry, of being abusive when I cry… I’ve even heard the classic line of “OOH here come the water works again” or “stop acting like an Abuse victim”. As well as being told I’m obviously so upset because I’m crying (no duh) while he is obviously not upset with me and thinking sooo rationally because he’s not crying.  I’ve even asked him multiple times how he could not even try to comfort his girlfriend when she’s crying and instead just choose to be meaner.  He of course never had a kind nor supportive response to that. 

Ironically, we’ve also had emotional conversations where HE cried and I didn’t.  In which case I was never mean in response (surprise surprise).  Albeit these were “talks” after an argument where he was no longer angry yet was also coercing me to apologize for how the fight was all/partly my fault. 

It’s so confusing even though I know the answers are probably obvious.

I simply couldn’t take it anymore I was terrified I was going to loose my baby and that was my last straw with him. I called the cops and told them what happened no one is mad at me for that. People are mad at me because I really want him to just stay away I have full custody of my child and as far as I am concerned he I just a sperm donor. Am I wrong for feeling this way?

I can't leave because I lost my job and, as the finest narcissist he is, he decided he wanted to help me.  in hindsight, I know why… I have no other support network and I feel suffocated, trapped.

I left as soon as I realized he was manipulative, not even abusive. He was simply negging me. We were only in the talking stage. The breakup didn’t stop him. Things (the hoovering) only escalated from there.

We had been friends/acquaintances since years before this. I thought that even if we were nothing, we were friends. I’ve done nothing except for be there for him. I was there when his dad died, I was there when he needed help with his electives, I was there when he didn’t know how to prepare for his exams (except that he was lying about this bit so that we’d spend more time together). I tried so hard to build him up. I’m not saying that I was the perfect partner but I was trying my best.

He doesn’t like the part that’s argumentative and speaks up so he’s trying his best to undermine my confidence. 

He knows who I am, it was exactly why he liked me but ig he saw me more as a challenge to be “conquered”. He can’t seem to live with the fact that he couldn’t break me. Makes me question what I did to deserve this. I’ve been nothing but supportive. I’ve been nothing but a friend. He couldn’t break me so instead he’s trying to assert himself and force me to be what he wants.

1434,I hate what this relationship has become.,"My boyfriend of almost years followed me to work this morning to make sure I wasn't cheating.  I haven't cheated. This is unhealthy and driving me insane. 

I feel like my head is all jumbled with all thw wrongs I've done, all the ways I could have been better, howni could have treated him better. How I just wasn't ready so soon after my divorce to give him everything he wanted from me. 

So much has happened. I love him. He doesn't see his behaviors as unhealthy. We have to break up but I don't want to. My two kids from a previous relationship love him. I see so much goodness in him. It's overshadowed by his ptsd, his past awful experiences, his lack of hope in himself.
He has mental health issues. He thinks so low of himself. 

I have thought the world of him and told him so. This didn't stop him from questioning, accusing, and just having a general mistrust of me. Up until we broke up, I didn't give him any reason to mistrust me.

I’m not allowed to be a part of it or for anyone to know about me. We can’t have any sort of social media presence but they do. They talk from 6:00am to 8:00pm everyday, all day long. Even when he’s with me. They talk about what’s going on with his family and gossiping about her friends and other people. He says it’s just about the kids but they can’t go more than 10 minutes without texting each other. I’m hidden and tucked away and only brought out when he wants to go out or do things she wouldn’t do. I don’t feel like I’m dating him, I feel like I’m their third wheel.

He promised it would change, but nothings changed. And I’m not allowed to talk about it because then he says I make him feel shitty for spending time with his kids. Am I wrong? I don’t care that he does that, it’s only her involvement and how close they are that upset me, but he never acknowledges it just tells me that he shouldn’t feel shitty for spending time with his kids.

1444,Hate he’s this person,"My boyfriend is emotionally and physically abusive and it saddens me that after every terrible relationship I’ve been in, that I’m in something even worse. Typically, when we first met it was nothing like this. He was an amazing guy but obviously his “true” side is now showing. I love him. I don’t want to leave him, but I’m seeing that’s starting to be the only option  other than staying. Today he put a gun to me and threatened to kill me or my family and I had to pick one. I luckily talked him out of it, but he claims he’s gonna go and cheat on me since that’s what I think anyway. This all started cause he eventually admitted to getting rides from some girl. That she looks 3x better than me and that if he wanted her, he’d be with her. That I am lucky that he doesn’t cheat on me like other guys do. After expressing how bad my self esteem is, I can’t believe he would say this. I feel so lost and stuck. I’m sad that this what has come of my life. Honestly I felt he was “the one.” He was the guy that was gonna be different than any other guy I’ve dealt with and in ways he is, but in other ways he’s worse. I deal with depression, anxiety and type 2 bipolar disorder so I feel I’m losing it. I just lost my job and he totaled my car over a month ago. I know you guys are gonna tell me to leave, but how do I do it without feeling like I’m abandoning him? He’s depressed and bipolar also. He’s been through so much in his life and I want to be there for him but obviously he’s made that very hard for me. I feel I can’t get over his comments about other girls because my self esteem is at an all time low. Idk. I guess I don’t even need advice because I feel I’m gonna stay anyway. I just wish things were different for me. I wish he was different. Putting everything into perspective, I’d rather die. And that’s just being honest. My life sucks.

I really did love him.. i would have spent my whole life with him; until i saw he was a disgusting human being who was trying to control every aspect of my life. have to remember who I thought he was, it wasnt really him. That was a mask he put on to lure me and others in. I hope he will be lonely forever. Hes been taking advantage of women decade(s) younger than him. I absolutely hate who he really is. He is a pathetic dried up loser. He is heartless but i thought he genuinely was a sensitive sweet soul. I really thought he was. It confuses me how he potrayed himself as a misunderstood, hurt soul who is kind to others and brings smiles to everyone... but when it was just me and him, yes, it was good sometimes but he would coerce me into sex almost everytime, i couldnt go out anywhere, not even my job or the store, without hi accusing me of being a cheater, spamming my phone with guilt trippy messages. 

My dreams certainly always remind me of the terror he put on me... im tired of those dreams. Im safe now but i hate when I miss him because i kniw that's not really him.

My neighbors hate me and my family. They hear my partner yelling and screaming and throwing things. It’s humiliating. I’ve told him it humiliates me and he doesn’t care obviously. 

They’ve confronted me in the past about his yelling and screaming at all hours of the morning and night. They know we have a 2 year old. 

I successfully got him to move out for a few months, but he strong-armed his way back in last month because he “became homeless” due to the pandemic. He also made sure — without my knowledge — that I’m not on the lease. And that nothing in the house is mine, except for my clothes and a few things. I also work from home regularly, aside from the pandemic. 

My neighbors were supportive when he left, told me about their own experiences in abusive relationships, etc. I know I’m dumb for letting him back in. 

I’m working on getting a place of my own but I have no family or support system in this state. It’s taking a while and I’m just trying to survive.

Now that he’s back, my neighbors won’t even say hello to me or my son. I guess I don’t care, it’s just another layer of humiliation on top of it all.

Some people shouldn't even be awarded children. I just think its best to stay away from him and the baby too because of his actions he's so unstable....

Later he touched my boob a little and we kissed passionately, I didn't tell him to stop and it felt nice but I just couldn't, I wanted sex but at the same time I was repulsed just by the idea. I told him eventually that it's still a no and it was totally fine we just snuggled a bit more and he wasn't annoyed or showed frustration at all.

I used to check his social media more often than I’m proud to admit. But he was openly dating his affair partner within a week of our relationship ending. The one he constantly accused me of cheating on him during. Ha!

Anyway, a few months ago he reached out to me out of the blue. I’m well past the checking in phase, I no longer go anywhere near his or his girlfriends social media. It’s been years since I have. I told him not to contact me again, blocked him, and thankfully have not been bothered. However my interest got piqued, unfortunately. I checked up on socials and they obviously are no longer together. 

Part of me wants to reach out to her, his new ex. Just to check in.

1471,I really hate feeling like this,"My last relationship was incredibly toxic and abusive. I was stuck in a trauma bond, but finally decided I was done in May 2020, after truly accepting that he had been cheating and lying to my face consistently for months. I was in denial about him fathering a baby to the girl he cheated on me with twice, the last time being before he went to jail and I left. 

I went no contact in May, blocked him on everything and started to work on my happiness. Since being released from jail, he reached out about 4 times. The first was a phone call on unknown number. We talked, he said he’d buy a ticket for me to fly out and see him, then his response to baby confrontation was “I’m not on the birth certificate.” I was done after that. 
Second time, got an email asking for money. Told me I was the only one he could rely on. I did t respond. He again called on unknown number, I cussed him out for 30 seconds and then hung up on me. 3rd time, added me on FB from new account, blocked him. 
Now this last time, has me shook. Got a text message from an iCloud email. I should’ve just ignored it, but I have been struggling hard with coming to terms. When I say I went off, that’s an understatement. I absolutely tore into him. His response was a dagger to the heart to say the least. He told me how his BM has done more for him than I ever did (cannot possibly fathom this as true given he bankrupted me) and that I caused him to miss the most important day of his life, despite him already having a criminal record. He blames me for calling police relating to DV stuff. 
I know I’m better off. I know he doesn’t deserve me. I know the hurtful things he said about me aren’t true. But why does it hurt so much? And does he really feel like she’s better? How he could be happier being broke, homeless, begging me for money and help, than with me when he could’ve wanted for nothing? 
His child’s mother is the woman he prostituted. I come from a great family, and am educated. How is she a better option than me???

I live in the us and he lives in Ecuador so I returned back to the u.s after he hit me one time and he pleaded for me to come back but I warned him that I would call the cops on him if he laid his hands on me again. So I came back and he left my face more messed up than before so I called the cops on him and now he is doing 15 days in ecuadorian jail. I feel bad because they say things are rough in their now, that's what his family told me. Inmates are killing one another, but I spoke to the police and he said as long as he behaves he'll be fine. It doesn't seem like he wants to be with me anymore because I went to court and he didn't even acknowledge me, which I get because he's never been to jail before and i put him in there. But I love him and he still will be the father of my child and I don't want to abort although my family says to and I just feel really stupid and messed up for putting him in there. I Thought they would give him less time. Also I place my hands on him sometimes too so I just feel like I should'nt have put him in there at least not for that long.

I keep catching myself wondering where he’s staying & if he’s ok. Like he’s the one that got beat up & not the other way around. He got physical (pulling my hair out & hitting me & shoving me down a few times) right in front of the kids. I didn’t call the police (just because I didn’t want to traumatize them even more making them talk to the police & whoever else about it). But I KNOW that I’m not letting him come back this time. Not after that. My son(6) doesn’t want him here either. When I told the kids he wasn’t coming back my son  said “yay” super quietly as he was trying not to cry. But he hasn’t tried to come back or call me or anything & it’s been so super calm & peaceful since he’s been gone. I’m done for real this time & even told my older boys (19 & 16) what he did to me & I’ve been telling as many people as I can so that everyone knows what is going on so that I will hold myself to not taking him back FOR SURE this time. I’m not doing this to my kids. It’s so traumatic & hard to heal from when they see stuff like that. Anyway… It’s been just a little over a week & I’m just lonesome sitting here by myself BUT I KNOW I would be miserable if he were here still. I just feel like the more I say it the more I mean it. I’m so glad it wasn’t any worse than it was. I guess I just need to hear that I’m not crazy for feeling the way I do I guess (or am I?) …. Idk. Thanks for listening to me tho if you made it this far. I’m trying so hard to not be too sad about it all. My baby is such a sweetheart & im not gonna let him see his dad keep treating me like that. That’s why he’s the way he is….

1505,I Regret Calling the Police,"I feel so stupid. It’s been 2 1/2 weeks since I was physically assaulted by my boyfriend and 1 1/2 weeks since I called the police and reported it. I know objectively that it was the right thing to do. He hurt me and if anything had gone wrong, I could have died. I should be scared of him and part of me is. It’s like all I want to do is be with him, but my body is screaming for me to run.

All that said, I just want to be with him. I don’t want him to get arrested. I don’t want him to hate me. I don’t want him getting hurt at all. I know how twisted that sounds considering the fact that it’s my life that’s in danger if I stay with him, but I can’t stop thinking like this. It’s like the more time passes, the more I wish that I hadn’t called. My family/friends keep saying how proud they are that I advocated for myself, but I hate hearing that. The truth is that I didn’t even call for myself. I was so sad and scared and broken when I told my family/friends what he did to me. I was so lost and didn’t know what to do, so the moment my mom told me to call the police, I just went on autopilot. I didn’t call for me. I didn’t care about my own life. I called so that my mom wouldn’t have to be scared of him hurting me again. 

I realize how awful this sounds and how lucky I am to have the support of my friends/family. I know that there are people in even worse situation who would love to have even half the support that I got from them as well as the law enforcement officials I’ve been working with. I hate myself for feeling this way, but I can’t make it stop. I just want him with me so badly it hurts.

1508,"I don't say no to sex, because I don't feel like I can.","We--two females--fluctuate between a dead bedroom and very intense, BDSM encounters. 

When we do have sex, here's what happens:

I start thinking that sex will make her stop hurting me, that it will keep things from escalating. 

She tells me how needy I am, how grateful I should be that I get these encounters, how horrible it is that I dare be aroused and try to initiate when she kisses me.

I get down on my knees and beg. I don't cry. I know now to keep the tears inside because she said it bothers her when I cry during sex. She smiles, a benevolent ruler, and debates whether I deserve to be touched.

It feels so good to be touched after months of not being. I hate her touch. I hate the way my body responds. She makes me feel sick inside.

To get through the experience, I go someplace else in my head.

Where I take my time with her and am soft, she rushes and is rough. Part of me wants to feel that I matter enough to her to be desirable; the other part just wants her to stop.

I know better than to say no or push her away.

When she penetrates me, she doesn't do enough foreplay. She doesn't use lube. She doesn't listen to my requests for different positions, less force, etc.

Her fingers hurt. Her weight on top of me hurts. Her mouth hurts. I know better than to complain; she mocked me before, for daring to critique her.

I hate her roughness. I need her roughness. If she didn't want me, she wouldn't touch me--right?

When she's done, she says she loves me. I say it back because it's what she expects. When she falls asleep, I allow myself to cry.

I cannot shake the feeling that even though I said yes, I did not consent. 

I cannot shake the feeling of being violated. 

A hollow, dark hole opens up inside me, afterwards. Out of it pours sadness, pain, and resentment. I vow this will be the last time, even though I know it won't. 

I come back into my mind and body and terror grips me. I come back to myself and feel the soreness; the bruises I allowed her to leave make me sick. 

All I keep thinking is that it's my fault because I said yes. That if I were stronger she would leave me alone.
That I'm not allowed to feel this way because there wasn't real force or anger.

1520,I messed up,"I left my abusive ex a little over 9 months ago. I’ve been in contact with him on and off still just because I’d rather have him have a line of communication then show up at my house randomly. He was very physically abusive to me, has almost killed me, and a recovering addict. After I left I kind of spiraled into a dark place in the sense of not wanting to feel lonely so I would see other men. I also think it was a form of self harm and definitely my crippling loneliness (I’ve always struggled with this). Recently I decided I wouldn’t do that anymore and I didn’t meet any men for about a month (ik not to long). But it was so hard and the loneliness started turning into real self hated like I’d randomly start crying bc I would think of my myself as worthless bc I can’t be normal and just be happy alone. So I caved and met up with a guy that I’ve seen before and after I felt so awful about myself. Then my abusive ex called while I was driving home while I was thinking some really dark things and he knows me really well so he could tell something was wrong. Long story short he said the right things at the wrong time and I ended up seeing him again for the first time since I left. At first I was so scared and uncomfortable but he made me laugh and I told him everything and he was just telling me that it was going to be ok and even if I don’t want him he’ll always just be there for me. He’s been sober and apparently doing better(his words). Ik he lives in a sober house though so I at least know he’s actually sober but I feel so stupid for even maybe believing him. I hate myself for seeing him after everything he’s done to me. And the fact that he actually ended up making me feel better just makes me feel worse.

I went back to my abusive ex and I just left again yesterday after he randomly thought I was cheating and lying and put his hands on me again. He screamed at me for hours, wouldn’t let me sleep and degraded me and snatched me up multiple times. He even held his hand over my mouth and I couldn’t breathe.

I really thought he was gonna hurt me really really bad. Sorry gonna vent a little bit to but I miss him and I love him but I know it will never work cause he’s got mental issues beyond me. I hate this. But do abusers actually think your cheating or do they deep down know you’re not and just want a reason to abuse you? I know most people project but my abuser wasn’t cheating. He’s not a cheater. So do you think he does this just to abuse me or is it cause he’s so insecure and literally becomes delusional?

1527,I just Want to Talk to Him,"The title kind of says it all. I want to talk to him so badly it hurts. He’s currently out of custody on supervised bail. Part of his bail is contingent on him having no contact with me. I understand that that was done for my safety, but it hurts to not be able to know how he’s doing. He blocked me on everything within a few hours of getting out of custody. The not knowing is the worst. I wouldn’t even mind if he said that he hated me and never wanted to talk to me because at least I’d KNOW that’s how he felt. 

That and just when I started to think that I could maybe stop thinking about how much I want to see him, he unblocked my number. He won’t answer the phone, but it’s not doing the one ring and straight to voicemail anymore. It’s ringing like a regular call. Now I’m stuck wondering if he’s trying to manipulate me into calling so that he can use it as evidence that I’m not actually scared of him or if he did it because he actually misses me and wants to know if I call. 

I know this is stupid and a lot of people would be grateful to have no contact with the person who hurt them. I just hate not knowing how he’s feeling and I don’t know how to stop obsessing.

1530,Is it normal for a victim to worry that they were actually the abuser?,"I've (22f) been out of an extremely toxic relationship for almost three months now. I feel I was abused sexually and emotionally. I KNOW i was abused at least sexually for a fact.

Sometimes I'll go a couple weeks hating his (23m) guts and knowing that it was all his fault and I didn't deserve the things he did to me.

But then sometimes it'll be the complete opposite for a while. I'll think I was the horrible girlfriend and the perpetrator of all the abuse just like he always said i was. Then I'll convince myself that im a narcissist and a horrible person and fixate on it for hours on end for like 2 whole weeks. Its exhausting and I hate myself to the point where I want to isolated from everyone in my life so none of them get hurt by me.

I did do some toxic things. He broke up with me 1-2 times a month (we were together a year and a half) and after the first 8 months I started reacting in a pretty toxic way. I would find whatever way I could to make him stay even if it meant having a full blown tantrum or manulating him or promising sexual favours that I otherwise wasn't comfortable with. I think it was reactive abuse to the things he did to me. But what if it wasn't? What if I am just super toxic and manipulative. What if the things HE was doing was reactive abuse to the way that I treated HIM????? I've been fixated on this almost every moment where my brain isn't occupied on other things.

The trouble is the relationship was so traumatising for me that I have a really hard time remembering what happened. I THINK he gaslighted me so much that I can't trust myself. But honestly right now I can't even remember him gaslighting me. I just remembered vaguely thinking ""im being gaslit"" while the abuse was happening but I don't properly remember the things he did to abuse me. Which makes me worry that im just making it all up and victimising myself like he said I did. Ughhh. 

Does anyone else experience this kind of thing? Where you worry that you were actually the abuser and not the victim?",irrelevant,no,yes,cannot be inferred,yes,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
1531,I'm scared I will go back to my abuser.,"A couple of weeks ago, my abuser went too far. He could have killed me. It wasn't the first instance of physical violence, a lot has happened. He was an addict, and that part of our relationship had already caused so much damage. When he got clean I thought things could get better, but it turned out he was a worse person off the drugs. I've completely lost myself because of the abuse. 

I should be happy to be gone. I should be happy he went to jail. I should be glad the judge put in a 2 year protective order. But I'm not. I'm not excited about my job interview, or getting a car, or being at my family member's house or being away from him. I'm miserable. I miss him. And I know how he is, he will try to still call me or text me when he gets out of jail. And when he does I already know I will go back. I hate myself for it too. I hate myself for wishing I hadn't called the police. 

Right now, I know I will go back when he asks. Something is wrong with me. I can't stay away from him, even when he hurts me.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred

He took long so I got curious and I asked him “can I see ur recent watches tik toks “ he said no and started getting mad so I reacted and was on top of him while he layed back down and I was gonna go over and reach out for his phone in the side, He got “scared “ and put his fist up like I was gonna slap him, I got mad and took offense because I thought he threatened me as “I’ll punch u “ type of feeling. So I started cat fight slapping him and than he got mad kicked me and he kicked the side of my rib. It hurts still Ngl. So than I said “let me go through ur tik tok watched history” he pushed the chair that was beside us with his foot and his family was in the house. He started yelling and said “no I ain’t letting see it “ I than sat down on the bed and got mad because he started yelling at me than I got up and grabbed his PlayStation remote and slammed it to the ground.

That was the only thing that makes me happy and u ruined it.” Than I tried talking to him because he did that before to me he threw 2 of my other remotes on the concrete of the floor outside my house because he was mad. I am not understanding why he didn’t let me go through his tik tok history. I really don’t know. Beside that he yelled at me and sat down his chair “I hate u. I hate loving u . Ur the worst person I ever been in a relationship with.” Etc I kept looking at him in front of his eyes and he kicked me out and said “leave we are done !” “I hate all of this relationship the only thing that made me happy was that,Something u couldn’t do.”Now I am in his bed we took a nap but he calmed down because I said “I’ll buy u a new remote “ but either way. I was still in pain with that hard kick he did. I layed down his bed beside him and asked him “u would’ve hit me right , after I did that remote incident.” He said “I tried to control my self so I shook u “ . Should I keep my guard up.

1546,"I used to love sex, but now find it so mortifyingly embarrassing that I can't enjoy it.","I used to be so sex positive. So open to new things, so confident. I don't know exactly where it went wrong - it may have been the rape I experienced, it may have been the emotionally abusive relationship in which sex was used against me, and caused an unwanted and traumatic pregnancy,  it may have been my abusive, narcissistic ex telling me I was terrible in bed, among other soul-destroying comments - maybe a combination of all of the above. 

Whatever the reason, I now hate sex. It drives me insane, because I really do want it. The drive is there, my current boyfriend is so sweet and respectful, I know he would never do anything to hurt me or make me uncomfortable. But even so, I just can't enjoy it. I feel embarrassed by the idea, I dread it, I feel so awkward when I'm doing it and I just.. hate it. 

I don't understand and I don't want to feel this way! I miss it so badly! Throughout the bad relationships I longed for nice, respectful and reciprocal sex, but now I have it I can't enjoy it.

2110,Starting to feel really tired and weak,"1 month since I left my abusive relationship. At first I was so happy and felt so free. Now I’m getting kinda low and sad.

We have a daughter together so we need to stay in touch. I know I need to limit the contact to the bare minimum but our daughter is only 4 months and I can’t keep her from him. I have a lawyer. He has the right to 50 % custody but she’s with me 75%  of the time and I don’t want to risk that. 

He is staying in my apartment that I’m paying for. It is really hard to get him evicted and might cost me a big part of my savings. He is demanding he stay for free for a year and I give him part of my savings. He is sick and has no income, I have been supporting us both. He has been emotionally and verballyh abusive mainly, and says i have to forgive him for our daughters sake. He’s been absuing me ”out of love”. I am so sad somebody can be this selfish and entitled. I have created a monster in letting him walk all over me for so long.

I am just getting really tired and sad and I hare him so much. He sent me flowers on valentines he paid with my money because he claimed he didn’t have money for food.

2112,Still in the same place months later,"I just need an outlet to share my thoughts. I thought that I would have left by now. I paid a lawyer months ago for a divorce but haven’t contacted them since. Things have been much less turbulent since “the incident” in August. There have still been some controlling behaviors but no name calling or blowing up. 

He went to counseling for about 8 weeks and then told me his counselor said he was “done” with counseling and he didn’t need to see her anymore. What?! I’ve been seeing my counselor for years now and I’m not just “done” after a few weeks. Then without discussion he got his keys back for his safe and the handgun is back on the bedside table. No “how do you feel about me getting my guns back” or anything just “I got my keys back”. 

I think my mind went from made up to confused after his grandmother was dying and I had to fill the role of emotional support for him. At that point I was planning to give him the papers but felt like I needed to be there for him. I was there with him when she passed. The next week he got deathly sick and he needed me to take care of him. After that I have been so confused about what to do. 

He seems to have stopped reading his Bible every morning, but still prays for our dinner before we eat and buys me flowers every week. He’s cursing less. Is this real change or is he “faking”? How long before the “real” him would come out? Every so often he makes a passive aggressive comments to me. Usually something about me not having sex with him or someone “sliding into my DMs”. (No one is sliding in my DMs). He was gone for thanksgiving and I was by myself for the first time since “the incident”. I didn’t realize how much stress and anxiety I have been living with until he came back home. He asked me to do something and I didn’t want to do it. He asked if I thought he would do it for me and I said no. That was the wrong answer because he got angry. He didn’t blow up but was saying passive aggressive things (“you think I’m a terrible person if you don’t think I would do that for you”, “welcome home me”, “should have just stayed x”, etc) and immediately I felt all the stress and anxiety creeping back in. No wonder I haven’t been able to manage my weight these last few years.

My 18 month old crying. Finally he was able to say it:” I don’t love you I want a divorce. “ I felt my heart sank but I didn’t cry over us… I was crying for my kids…he said to the kids they were lucky to have two holidays, all dependent on alimony and child support, stabbed the table and threw the bread down at me with a big grin “happy anniversary hunny” and left.

2542,When your first relationship crumbles,"I have been with my boyfriend for 4 years 23 F & 26 M. Throughout that time he has shown me time & time again that he is not faithful to me. From my knowledge it has never been physical & maybe thats why I’m still here. We have broken up many times & he has always begged for me back. He is my first love and it is hard to stay away. 

We have a 15 month old daughter together & she is a light in our lives. She has a great relationship with both of us & maybe this is what makes this decision so difficult. Him & I fight non stop, there is always tension between us. He hasn’t wanted to have sex or initiated in so long. I long for love, closeness, dates, flowers, quality time. He prefers to play video games or sleep. It is so extremely upsetting & I can’t help but feel that I am wasting my best years on a dead relationship. He has told me many times how he hates spending time with me, hates everything about me, how i stress him out so much. Just to turn around & say how he loves me and wants to really try. I feel so insecure & just awful most of the time.

 I still love him but even during pregnancy hell even after the baby I was still finding microcheating in his phone. I am terrified to leave as I know he will most likely beg for me back. He doesn’t let me leave, he will hide the car keys. There are good moments of course, but they only include our baby. I feel that my child needs a good role model & I deserve sex & love & attention.

2559,Did he blame me for his (minor) injury?,"I am very new to learning that my bf of 2 years might be abusive, sorry if this is a dumb question.
I want to describe a situation that happened yesterday, ans hope that someone can help me to identify abuse, if present in this situation. 

I(f26) and my bf (m45) were climbing. I did a route, which was tagged as pretty hard on the first try and it felt pretty easy. My bf didn't see me doing it, so he asked me how hard the route was. I told him that it felt pretty easy. So he tried it too, and hurt his finger. Important to know is that my bf climbs way longer and better than I do, so he is capable of assessing the risks/assessing his ability to climb said route in a safe way. 
When we sat down to rest, he told me that it was my fault that he hurt his finger. I told him that this is not the case, to which he said: ""well, I am not saying that it is your fault, but this would have never happened without you. You told me the route was easy. Without that, I wouldn't have tried it"" 

I got the silent treatment on that day and the following day (today), however the reason for that could also be that he hurt his finger.
I am confused because he blamed me, then told me he didn't blame me and then did it again??

Then he asked for the address and I refused to give it to him bc he was cussing and yelling and calling me back to back.

Our son was home sick from school he hasn’t called or texted to check on him. But he came to my job and cussed me out bc his son is sick and he doesn’t know where he is.

2570,I left my abusive ex while pregnant,"One day I just got tired. I got tired of the abuse, I got tired of being called out my name, I got tired of being mistreated and misunderstood, I got tired of being yelled at for existing, and I got tired of being unloved. I saw an opportunity to leave once and for all and I packed everything while I was 36 weeks pregnant and I left him. I didn’t care that I was going to be homeless and staying in a shelter, all I knew was that I was leaving him and I was never EVER going back. When I was packing I remember him helping me pack my things and telling me I needed to hurry up and get out, and I remember telling myself that this was the last time I will ever put up with this. I left him October 1st and I ended up giving birth to my baby October 19th. It was me and my baby, it was me by myself. He made postpartum horrible for me, I cried everyday, I had to learn to be a mom and get through a heartbreak at the same time. I tried to coparent but I realized that he didn’t love my baby, it was about continuing to have access to control me and hurt me. I have finally cut ALL contact, I am almost 5 months postpartum and I am finally away from him and free from him completely now. 

For anyone dealing with an abusive partner, there is hope. If you are thinking about escaping you are strong enough to do it.

2573,Abusive Ex With Someone Else.,"So I guess the title kinda tells you. My abusive ex officially started dating someone else. He posted it on the only place that we’re still friends not on any other social media. I obviously totally forgot I had them on Tik tok as I don’t use it. But seeing it sent me into a spiral, I didn’t really expect. I hate that he’s happy. I hate that he can lie to somebody else that he’s a good person. The intense guilt and responsibly I feel towards her. I still have all the videos and text messages and voice recordings of him, threatening my life and locking me in our bedroom and putting his hands on me and burning my stuff and telling me our he released our sex tape. How has others coped with this part of was leaving and abusive ex? 

I don’t want to reach out to her as I think it’s pretty pointless. I was warned by a girl and he manipulated me into thinking she was crazy. But the intense guilt I feel is beyond what I thought it would be. 

I am angry I didn’t press charges when it was happening. I loved him too much and was too scared. I’m glad I got away, but I still hate that It follows me. 

Part of me wishes he would show up and try to break in again so I could finally put him in jail. 

Does anyone think it’s worth sending the new girl all the proof I have of his abuse? Warned her even if she won’t leave? Maybe she’ll see the signs faster than I did. I’m pretty lost and confused atm.

Update
So I messaged her. Send her one voice recording of him breaking into my house and attacking me. Just have her my number and told her she is always welcome to reach out. She responded within 10 mintues and was extremely sweet. Said she has made sure he would not contact me and seemed truly upset I had to experience that. Although, she believed him when he said he was just “going through a rough time” and he told her “his side of the story” and she is going to “stick by him”. Said he has gotten help (whatever help someone can get in a month after being a serial abuser for 8+ years with multiple women). I achieved my goal of warning her and she seems so nice which makes it worse. He’s hurting someone nice again. My followers went down by almost 10 right after she responded so I know he still had burner accounts following me. I believe he’ll leave me alone and I just hope she’ll see it soon.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,plausibly,,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,yes
2585,I’m pregnant by my ex,"I (24F) found out I was pregnant (7/8 weeks) by my ex partner (25F) a few weeks ago. If you haven’t read my previous post please have a look for some context. 

In summary the police are involved due to that last time he hit me. I defended myself with several weapons and we was both arrested as a result. During my hours in that cell I couldn’t stop thinking about every single time he would just attack me. In the most shocking ways..but I still love him. For so many reasons more than one but I of course know this man will never change. I’ve given him more chances than I can count and he’s shown me exactly who he is every single time. 

Every time he would promise and swear until the next time. A few weeks ago I sent him an email telling him I’m pregnant. Didn’t hear any word back from him which I wanted that to be the case because I can’t get in contact with him..if I do I know I’ll get swept right back into the cycle of me constantly being frightened. But I sent that email because I couldn’t go through with the termination without telling him. Morally I couldn’t do it and I know he’s been through similar situation without the knowledge of the abortion prior. 

I just wanted to tell him I’m pregnant and I don’t want a child in this type of circumstance. It’s really horrible to say but sadly I’ve been there and done that with my son. I’ve been a single parent from the start of my motherhood journey. I refuse that for any of my future children. I want a family, two parent household, stability in every way before I have more children and I know that’s something he could never give me. 

So today I’ve made the decision that I am going ahead with the abortion. I’ve been in contact with a clinic that sends kits to my home, which was sent last week. I’ve decided to take the first set of tablets once I’m home. I just feel this overwhelming level of guilt and shame. I wanted to have this man’s children. Before all of the abuse and he’s literally taken that from me because he couldn’t control himself and now I feel forced into this choice I’ve made and I’m gonna be going through this alone.

2594,My psychotherapist says it would be okay if I got back together with my physically abusive ex. HELP PLEASE.,"I (26f) go to therapy twice a month. I am on and off witn my abusive ex. You can find more info on my page but he slapped me really hard 5 years ago, made my nose bleed and I got a deviated septum from it. I developed PTSD and wake up some nights. We still see eachother about once a week and hang out for like 2 hours outside, but that’s it for now. I told him I need time to figure things out. He started going to a domestic abuse therapy program specifically for abusers. Most of the men who get sent there are court ordered, but he willingly went so he could prove to me that it would never happen again and that he’s safe to be around. He also pays for my therapy. He says he wants to do what’s best for me, even if I decide to never get back together.


 Anyway I’ve been seeing my psychotherapist for about 2.5 months now. She knows the story. Yesterday I told her I was feeling proud that I finally can see myself living without him. That I’ve had enough of feeling scared and that I want to put all this behind me. But I also said a part of me still loved him, and wished I could still be with him under different circumstance. This is when she had some ideas. She said if I choose to forgive him, then I *can* be happy in our relationship and let go of this anger and fear. She says I can do either EDMR or radical acceptance therapy. She says I need to come to terms with what happened (this is true). 

But I asked her “isn’t it bad to stay with someone who abused you? I would never tell my friend to stay if she was in this position.” And then she said because the abuse was only 1 time, because he’s going to therapy twice a month, and BECAUSE he’s paying for my therapy and being supportive, that she feels confident that he truly made a mistake and I might be able to accept it. She says forgiveness isn’t for the other person, it’s for me. I am willing to try the radical acceptance therapy for my PTSD. 

But I’m just so confused. I am lonely sure but I was pretty proud of how I am slowly breaking that trauma bond. And now she’s saying it would be okay to stay with him. I feel kind of triggered and I feel like she ruined the little stability I had. Would it really be okay to stay with him?

2603,is my ex stalking me ?,"hey guys, sorry for long post. i posted on here a couple times while leaving my abusive relationship and found it really helpful. gave me the courage to finally leave my last relationship around may, it was tough but i did it. i’m 23, my ex is 21 and we had gotten together in highschool and dated for a really long time about 6 years.

initially when we broke up i couldn’t move out due to my financial situation so i lived with him for a few more months and ended up meeting a new guy (29) that is the complete opposite and the sweetest man i’ve ever known. i kept it a secret while i was still living there but unknown to me my ex had my location on and followed it to the car i was in when he dropped me off one day and saw us kiss. he absolutely blew up and it got physical, i left that night and didn’t stay there again at all. came back only to pack my things and now live somewhere he doesn’t know the address of, have him blocked, no way for him to get my location anymore. 

well now it’s been probably 6 months since i’ve moved and i started seeing him around the neighborhood i work in. i wrote it off at first but after the first time i started seeing him like 4 times a week at night when i close. then when i’m open he would walk by and stare in the window, or when i’d go on break i’d see him walking close by. 

i really didn’t think he was following me but i got weird feeling and told my current boyfriend and my manager and showed them a picture just in case people saw him around when i didn’t. last night they caught him drinking and staring in the window at me saying my name. i didn’t even notice, i feel so scared. they confronted him but he didn’t seem scared or sorry, or like he would stop. i don’t really know what to do next. don’t they have to disclose your new address ss and other info if you file a restraining order? if any of you have experienced something similar let me know or what you’d advise i do next. thank you ",cannot be inferred,no,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,,yes,plausibly,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
2605,I miss my abusive ex,"I’m 24. I met my ex at 23 and Everything was great and I even said to my mom “wow he is so great I’m just waiting for something to happen”. The following day he got wasted and when I had picked him up from the bar he had started to belittle me saying things such as “I could do so much better than you” “no one cares about you” “no one will love you” “no one will date you” etc. this happened 3 months ago and it was really horrible. I still wake up everyday and think about those things. I stupidly ended up forgiving him and we dated for a few more months when I had finally had enough and broke things off. There were other instances after and before that were alarming but never as severe as this time. Flash forward to now I’m currently talking to a new guy who was around when I started dating my ex but I cut him off when I got into a relationship with my ex. He is really kind and sweet and we have been on a few dates and I do like him. I just want to know maybe why I still wake up everyday and think about my emotionally abusive ex. I kind of really miss him but I still think about all the hurtful words that were said. Also, this new guy I’m pretty positive is Intending to date me and I feel the same way but I am concerned that I still think about my ex and why I can’t stop thinking about my ex and when will I finally let go and if I need to let this new guy go considering I still think about my ex.",irrelevant,cannot be inferred,yes,no,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
2607,My therapist told me to email my abusive ex,"It’s only been a couple of days since I’ve left my abusive relationship. My abuser hasn’t hit me (but it’s gotten physical) so that “Forgive him” voice in my head is loud. 
I figure I’ll try counselling to seek help on how to quiet down that voice.

I told her my story, that I’ve left in a hurry while he was at work after an incident that terrified me. I didn’t leave a note but I was contemplating on txting him goodbye until I saw PLENTY advices in here not to. 

My therapist then asked “So he didn’t know why you left?” I told her “I’m hoping he’ll figure it out as I was upset and shaking after what he did as I’ve told him, yelled at him, many times before not to do that”. (He’s physically restrained me from leaving multiple times)
She then told me “But you need to spell that clearly to him. You need to document that you would like for him to stop contacting you. This way, if he tries to contact you again, you will have proof in the future that you have told him not to.”

After our session, I created a throw-away email address to msg my ex. I sat there, not knowing what to write. I don’t even know how I feel as it was still so fresh. Part of me is angry at what he did. We could’ve had a great life together if he was only able to control his emotions.
But then a part of me started missing him. Our laughs, our routine, inside jokes etc. He’s the first person I tell everything to and now I’ve lost that. 
I’ve lost what I thought was my bestfriend. 

So I just started sobbing, in front of my laptop screen with an empty email draft. 

This is why they tell you not to msg your abuser and just LEAVE. It’s that one moment of glimmer that sucked me right back in to the fake fantasy he’s brainwashed me on. 

After this session I’m convinced therapy isn’t a solution for both the abuser and the abused.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
2610,my ex hit me during sex,"i (f21) and my ex (f23) had been together for less than three months and started dating less than two weeks after meeting. she has been practicing and participating in kink and bdsm for over a year, and i have had zero experience with it.

we had talked about trying things over text (one of these being hitting during sex) over text we discussed how were both interested in trying this, but never specified or communicated directly when we were going to try this, because i assumed we would have an in person conversation about it before we were to do anything pertaining to hitting because we never had before. the next time she was over we werent even having actual sex yet just heavily making out and and all of a sudden she hit me in the face really hard. i genuinely was too shocked to even react. we never discussed safe words because i didn’t think i was going to need to come up with that or use one until we wanted to try this. 

am i wrong for feeling like she should’ve had an in person conversation with me about wanting to try this before we did it in person? i am assuming because we texting about wanting to do it she assumed i wanted to next time i saw her and that’s why she did it. if she were to have asked in person about trying it before we had sex that day, i would’ve said no because i just wasn’t feeling like it. i have been very clear about needing clear verbal consent during sex before she touches me or tries something new.",irrelevant,no,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

Then hung up on me. So then he calls me later tonight and sounded drunk, claims he wasn’t but lol he was.. and to sum it up he was saying he’s f*****d up about me (meaning he’s like going crazy about me or is) and was going on about how I made him feel and he was saying he’d k*ll me and that’s why he stays away from me, brings up a girl (he kept doing that for the last few weeks and I knew there was somebody else but he kept trying to call me to make things right etc) and so he said he was f*****g her better than me, she’s an entrepreneur she does hair, just boasting her up. Never did he do this about me. He said I had nothing going on for myself and im the reason he’s broke but he asked me for $50 the same day he said he had two jobs and that he made more money than me… and he keeps bringing up Cuba or something. Apparently he’s going with that girl? And that he’s treating her better than me and she’s reaping the benefits of what I didn’t want ig etc saying he has another girl who cares about him and it’s funny because he first mentioned Cuba before we last broke up a few weeks up acting like he was “in trouble” and we wouldn’t be able to talk for a few days but it was b****s*it. I’m hurt… I was hurting this whole time since we been broken up, and im trying my hardest to get over it… but him doing that and saying hurtful things like im going to be in the same spot in life was hurtful when he knows all my plans… meanwhile he’s broke is confused about his s*xuality etc and I still loved him I just feel stupid for even asking for advice or what this even means?

2615,Email from ex,"Hi guys, it’s been a while since I’ve posted, and tbh I thought my whole ordeal was over. Just a little quick background, I broke things off in April last year but officially blocked my ex a few mos later in August - I was trying to stay in his life as a support person, but the abuse never really stopped (I essentially just moved out but everything continued). So I blocked him in August but agreed to unblock him in October (set a specific date/time) in order to check on each other with a phone call. Well, I started therapy shortly after blocking him and realized that phone call wouldn’t be good for me. I never unblocked him, but I sent him a letter basically stating that I needed to put myself first and I wouldn’t be unblocking him and that I wished him the best. 

Hadn’t heard from him until just today, when he sent an email stating that I promised him that phone call and that he still has questions and he deserves closure. It immediately sent me into panic mode seeing a message from him. I don’t plan on following through on that phone call, but there’s a small part of the old me that popped back up and made me wonder if I was doing the right thing. I’m also afraid to ignore the email and just block him, because what if he shows up in person next? Should I respond just to decline? I really don’t want to engage at all. I’m not sure what to do here, I don’t have a therapy session for the next week or two so was just wondering what everyone’s thoughts were and if anyone has had a similar experience",cannot be inferred,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

There was an issue of residency when we split so I am so happy to have the new place where he has never lived. I don’t want him coming here so I have a residential stay away order, and I am trying to keep the address private from him for my safety. Recently, I set up a time for ex and son to see each in a public place, I wanted my ex to stay in our son’s life. The abuse was not directed at my son, but he did witness it. During the visit ex told me that he wanted to take our son to his house (undisclosed, private location), but I said no I am not comfortable with that. He tried to manipulate our son to convince me, saying that our son’s Christmas presents were at his house. I tried to figure out another way he could get the presents today, but ex refused. Later he texted me that he wanted to meet us tomorrow to give him the presents, but we are going to be busy. He asked if I would like him to mail them, to which I said yes and I gave my parent’s address. Then he revealed that he had my new address and was going to send them there. Like he texted me the address to my new place. I feel so unsafe, I just signed a lease but maybe I should move again. I feel like my safety and well-being is his to take away if he pleases. Also I need to figure out how he found it out. Is he tracking me, did he hack my device, did he find in randomly? Also has he been there when I was away, did he come in here and install cameras?

2630,Update on my abusive ex dying,"TW for death, suicide mention 

You can view my original post here 

https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/s/lKSfkxJZOf

I’m so sorry if I didn’t reply to anyone’s comments, I didn’t expect such an overwhelming response and so much wonderful support. I’m going to try to respond to more people on the original post today.

I’m seeing both my psychiatrist and therapist, which had been extremely helpful.

I was feeling a bit better about the guilt aspect since everyone has reassured me it is NOT my fault. But then.. I realized his family never reached out to me. Nothing good nor bad. So they probably think it’s my fault too. 

The obituary finally came out and I looked at it against better judgment. It’s so strange and surreal seeing his face with an obituary. It made it feel more final and more real so I’m struggling a bit today. I just saw it last night. Strangely, the family is not having a funeral but a “celebration of life at a later date.”

I can’t help but look at old pictures of us having fun before everything went wrong. I can’t help but think I could’ve changed him. I know that’s an illogical thought. I helped him see a therapist, I tried to get him to go to rehab. I encouraged him to ask his doctor about medications. I still don’t know if it was suicide or OD/heart attack from 11 years of cocaine use. I kind of don’t want to know.

Once again, I appreciate the support from this community more than I can even express <3",cannot be inferred,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
2635,I left my abusive ex,"I need to figure out how this happened again. I feel at fault because this is the second time I've been in an abusive relationship. He was my childhood friend; I thought he could never hurt me. I knew him as a gentle, mild-mannered kid. He was the funny one at the youth group, my best friend in middle school. I was convinced he was 'my person.' It started off as a random one-off, a bad day at work, stress, and an outburst that 'I caused.' Then it happened again. He apologized, told me he felt bad, begged me for forgiveness, and said it was out of frustration because of my behavior. Then it started happening every time I saw him. Before I knew it, I was silently sitting in the passenger side of the car. He was yelling at me about how I was going to be a horrible mother one day because of my anxiety. Tears filled up my eyes, and he started yelling at me about my crying. I couldn't take it anymore. I was starting to believe his cruel words, and it was scaring me. It's been four days since I walked away and ended it. I can't sleep, eat, or smile without pretending. I cry any time I'm alone.

2636,Ex husband plead guilty,"I just wanted to share that I know a lot of women/ men don’t get the chance to even try to have their abusers prosecuted. My soon to be ex husband started to be physically abusive during pregnancy… which continued to emotional abuse, lies, manipulation, cheating and serious mental abuse too. Postpartum he was AWFUL. So mentally abusive I thought I was going insane. His physical abuse ramped up so high after birth. He had bit my face, finger, smashed a phone into my glasses causing a laceration to my forehead and eventually strangled me with my 6 month old daughter in my arms. I called police that night and he was arrested. The trial was supposed to be tomorrow and I was fully prepared to face him in court. He will plead guilty tomorrow and I feel so relieved. His offer wasn’t what I thought it should be but it was so satisfying to know he was finally held accountable in life. Everyone around him always enabled him and now he will have abuse on his record. I’m so proud of myself for getting out of that situation, sticking it through, sticking to the restraining order and doing what’s best for my beautiful daughter.

2638,"Trial against my abusive ex, the saga continues….","This past Wednesday was another pre-trial hearing and my abusive ex did not show up. It was my understanding (and it’s basic protocol here in my state) that a warrant is issued by end of day - but the judge gave him a 48 hour reprieve. 

I left that day feeling defeated and incredible rage. Why does this “man”, this person who almost killed me continue to get passes? He’s a career criminal with a hefty record and served time 10 years ago. 

Came back again this morning - his lawyer didn’t show up, he was there for 10 minutes to get a new court date. I’ll be back at the courthouse in September. The DA has told me they want to plead out - and I’m working on my Victim Impact Statement to read to him and the judge no matter how this ends up. 

I finally called 911 on him back in March, received a 209a (Abuse Protection Order) and have been at every court date since. 

 This system is so incredibly broken, yet I’ve found comfort in the DA and my court appointed advocate, who listened to me cry today after the brief hearing. To have someone I attempted to love, attempt to strip my sense of self in all ways, is something nobody can grasp unless they’ve been through it (and I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy). 

I continue to show up, not just for me, but for every woman who has died at the hands of their partner, for the women who can’t leave - I feel them behind me when I am there. 

When this is rectified and I am healed, I will be going into advocacy for those who need it. Navigating this system on your own is overwhelming, yet I know in my heart that I am doing the right thing. 

To those who got this far, thank you. To those wondering if you need to leave an abusive situation, please leave. To anyone who may be considering pursuing legal action, feel free to DM me.

2642,Abusive Ex Husband Abusing new GF in front of our children,"My ex husband was physically abusive towards me during the last time I was pregnant, we moved our separate ways after two separate domestic violence cases in two different states. I’m married now and in a very loving relationship. He’s been with someone for about almost a year now and their relationship is definitely not stable. 
We have three children together and our daughter fights us to go to her fathers, fights the bus driver from school to get off the bus, etc etc. Her and her little brother do not want to go there. Our oldest gets video games shoved in his face so him being autistic doesn’t mind going. 
Our daughter was sent home from school yesterday morning due to a fever and her father wasn’t reliable or around to pick her up on his day, so I left work and took her to the doctors with her step father. Her step father and I were having a discussion and talking about a few things when she jumped up off the chair and yelled at him “Do not yell at my mommy and don’t try to hit her!” We were completely baffled as we weren’t even arguing. We then explained everything was okay and then asked the question “what do you mean? Where did you get that from?” She responded “well daddy and Julie fight and daddy slaps Julie across the face and throws her across the kitchen.” My next steps were to call a counseling agent and get her set up with a local office. I then brought her back to her dad’s and this time gave her, her iPod to play some games because she again didn’t want to go. 
Fast forward to today, I got her this morning and long behold there’s small videos of them arguing and hitting noises on the iPod.. what can I do? What do I do? He’s on probation for abusing me as it is and I’m afraid for my children in this situation.

2646,Anyone trying to coparent with their ex who was abusive?,"Coming up on 5 months since my ex was arrested for DV. We are still coparenting and it’s becoming increasingly frustrating. He wanted to video chat with her every night at 6:30 which I agreed to. He hasn’t shown up for 95% of these calls, and his parenting skills lack. He does the bare minimum, and I have to make sure he has food for her each time I go over because his fridge and pantry are usually empty. He doesn’t pick her up or drop her off ( he has no car but he has a bike with a bike seat and a helmet that I bought for her and I’m a 16 min bike ride away vs 10 min car) and there’s ample public transportation. 

I find myself crying over him still when I just want to forget that I wasted the last 8 years of my life on him and had his child. I love my daughter so much but I don’t want him to be her father. He does pay more child support than a court would probably order him to, and I need it badly. I just want to move on :(  anyone else in this boat? 

Also, just in case anyone is concerned-he’s never shown any abusive signs towards her (she’s 2) or ever even raised his voice. The dv against me was very few times but once is enough.

2650,Abusive ex wants to apologize after a year of no contact,"Hi there my ex (24m) and I (24f) broke up a year ago after he physically assaulted me and strangled me to unconsciousness. I sent a letter to him about 4 months after we split and went no contact because I wanted an apology. I think back then I wanted to forgive him and have him feel truly accountable for his actions, but I never got a response from him, so I went about my life and worked on healing. Now about eight months after that letter was sent he reached out to me saying that the letter was intercepted by his dad and he just saw it now. 
He wants to find a time to talk in person which was what I requested in the letter, and while I still want a true apology and to see him remorseful, I don’t know if I’d get that. 
I know that entering into a conversation like that is dangerous and could go a thousand different ways, but I was wondering if anyone else has had an abuser make an apology that was actually worth something. 
I’ll obviously have a trusted friend come with me to the conversation as a safety measure, but I’m afraid that he just wants to talk about himself and how he was impacted, instead of taking accountability for his actions. 
I don’t forgive him, and I know that’s what he’s looking for. I don’t want to get into a conversation where he has the opportunity to try and manipulate me into feeling bad for him or feeling bad about myself. 
If anyone has met up with an abuser after a period of no contact I’d love to know if it was a worthwhile conversation that helped you recover or if it just made everything hurt all over agin.

2653,Letter to my abusive narcissistic ex husband,"It's been 17yrs since you kicked me out. And in those 17yrs I've been in therapy I've learned that you are a narcissist. But I need to tell you thank you. Because when you kicked me out you gave me the chance to experience life on my own. I learned that I could breathe and not walk on egg shells all the time. I learned that not everyone is going to hurt me. I  learned that I am capable loving people and vise versa. I also learned despite what you think that I am an amazing wife and mother. 

After the years of therapy I have decided to forgive you. I'm forgiving you for turning my daughter against me. I know you thrive on it. Because you know how much it kills me that she and I aren't on speaking terms. 

I forgive you for beating me even tho I suffer horrible lasting debilitating effects from it. 

I forgive you for beating the boys even tho they probably hate you deep inside. That's on them not me. 

I forgive you for quiting your job at the drop of a hat and screwing the whole family but only thinking about yourself at that moment.

I forgive you for being disrespectful towards me in front of my family and friends and making feel like everything I ever did was never good enough for you.

I forgive you for ruining our kids childhood. For making them grow up feeling inadequate to other kids their age. For not being the role model they needed. 

I forgive you for all the lies you ever told me and the kids 

I forgive you for taking my kids away from me and not letting  have any contact with them for 9yrs. And continuing to trash my name to not only our kids but my family and now our 8yr old granddaughter 

In closing I want say that I am not afraid of you anymore. You and your threats won't keep me from coming  to see my kids or my grandchild. I won't think twice about pressing charges anymore if you do try anything like you did in the mall. Stop with the passive aggressive remarks about me on my family and friends facebook.

Like he calls me 7 times and texts me at 4 in the morning, almost a week after we broke up and about  a month since my first attempt to leave him, and he says “you know how I feel about you, I don’t even know what I did” you know that I don’t want you right???  And we are NOT in a relationship!!!!

2665,"Violent ex wants to ""come get his stuff"" 4 months later.","So I've had no contact with my abusive ex since I ended relationship before he was kicked out of the building I'm in (different apartment), and I've blocked his fb and number. No contact for almost 4 months.

I don't ask about my ex as it effects my mental health. However my neighbour (who works with my ex sometimes which is how I met him) told me last night that my ex texted him recently asking him ""Can I come get my belongings? I have expensive things there""

My neighbour asked him ""What belongings? You have no stuff here.""

He has no belongings here. His belongings were already picked up by his friend who he sent here like 4 months ago when he was evicted. I don't know if I'm supposed to concerned now. What's the point in asking if he can come get  his stuff when there is no stuff?

He's a high risk DV offender with an ankle monitor on him. I don't have a restraining order on him as I assumed he moved on with his life. Maybe I'm worrying for no reason and that it's a misunderstanding and he thought he has stuff here. Why wait almost 4 months though? I don't know.

When he left he sent me nasty messages and played mind games, and blame me obv. He also messaged my toxic family and told them I need help. I didn't react to this much and was actually pretty polite to him about it because I still loved him so much.  He has been blocked for a month and few weeks. I've been getting counselling and organising a restraining order. This morning I messaged his ex gf and child's mother who has a restraining order on him. The reason why was I just wanted to warn her that he is still abusive and will be on the prowl again and that he is living in her area. Well I ended up unsending it before she read it. I realised it could increase the danger for me , and also could possibly trigger her. The gf before me also messaged her about abuse as well, and they got along and shared stories, but I realised it's for the best I just don't talk to her.  Am I a bad person for trying to warn her? Like she didn't even need warning because she already knows. I just want him to stop hurting women and that was my way of trying to stop it. He's 25 and has been abusing women since high school. He has a history of stalking and strangulation and other abuse. I've decided to not be involved at all in that. Like I said I deleted the message before she saw it. I just feel like this makes me as crazy as him because I wanted to warn her.

2669,Accidentally Text Opposing Lawyer (Ex parte OFP Case),"So… I have an emergency order of protection on my husband for me and our 3 teens. He has already violated through 3rd Party Contact and my lawyer and I are asking him to sign in agreement for a 2 year no contact order or we press charges. The 3rd party contact happened with the kids when I was not home.

Yesterday, I went to get gas for the lawn mower and my kids text and called saying their Dad drove by real slow and they told he was going to turn into the driveway. I kept them on the phone until I got home, then had to calm them and they wanted to arrange spending the night with friends.

Then I started to panic. I called my lawyer, no answer. I called my DV advocate, no answer. Then I emailed screenshots of my kids texts and what happened to my lawyer and decided to scan the email thread to ensure I didn’t miss a cell number for my lawyer. 

I was shaking and panicked, but found a number in signature that said “Cell/Text”. I sent a text saying it was me and that my husband drove by the house and my kids saw it and freaked out. I said to check his email for screenshots and I asked if I should report or wait to see if he does it again. 

Still no response. So I double checked the number. I accidentally copied my husbands lawyer that my lawyer had forwarded in regards to when to expect a response. I CANNOT BELIEVE I DID THIS!!!!!!!! 

I did end up speaking to an advocate and we determined it would be ok and I am safe because he didn’t return. I am still obsessively googling this situation and I’m just really worried. 

Anyone know how bad this is or if it’s not a big deal? Not looking for legal advice, just want to ease my mind and shake this “omg I ruined everything” mindset. I’m tempted to just say I didn’t know I did it if someone mentions it but I don’t even know if that’s the right choice or maybe, as I said before, it’s not a big deal.

2673,Does your ex abuser ever go quiet for some time?,"My abusive ex bf was evicted about 3  weeks ago. I still live here. I plan to move as soon as I have more money. When notified of his eviction he escalated his abuse and threats. This included over 100 texts, followed me everywhere, door knocks, etc. He also brought over a woman whom he knew that I suspected he was cheating with, and as far as I know that has now fizzled out as she just got back with/moved in with another man. I stayed pretty calm through out this and didn't engage him.

&#x200B;

However since actually being evicted/leaving he has actually gone quiet, which is why I did not file protection order. I have not seen or heard from him which I'm happy about. I do not know where he is other then possibly on someone's lounge or homeless.  I know he had court coming up too for strangulation of his ex, so that he may be back in jail soon too. I do not contact him. I'm focused on rebuilding my life. I feel more safe without him here. However I'm always alert of noises and always watching my surroundings when I am out.

2680,In an active court case against my abusive ex. I am so angry.,"Some context - I was with my abusive ex boyfriend for almost 6 years. During that time, I was verbally, emotionally, financially, physically, and mentally abused. He stalked me when I tried to leave, threatened violence, hacked into my emails and phone logs. He is a narcissistic abuser who also abuses alcohol, and I had to leave my home to get away from him. Unfortunately, as many of us do, I reengaged with him. 

Back in March of this year, he threw me across my own apartment and I called 911. The state is now pressing felony assault and battery charges. I have been to every court date, ensuring him, his lawyer, the DA, and the judge all know I intend on seeing this through until the end. 

Today, I received a phone call from a private investigator, hired by his attorney. I began to talk, and then immediately stopped and said I did not feel comfortable speaking without a lawyer. I didn’t expect this whatsoever. 

I can’t begin to express how ANGRY I am. How disgusted I am by this attempt to poke holes in my story - a story that is the TRUTH. No wonder women (and I know abuse doesn’t discriminate based on gender) do not come forward, considering the hoops you have to jump through, and the continued trauma of being questioned. 

I hope this goes to trial - put me on the stand, I have nothing to hide. I was told by my advocate that defense attorneys will always try this to see if the police report aligns with what I tell the PI, and that I can hang up if they ever contact me again. 

I can’t wait for the day when this is over, so that I can move into a career and space where I can advocate for those who can’t, or are navigating this on their own, like I am currently.

2688,Abusive ex's and nasty cold behaviour.,"I think it's been 10 or so days since my abusive bf moved out to his mum's after I told him to leave. He messaged the guy in charge of the appartment complex and told him to lower my rent as he isn't coming back. I am in a crappy appartment alone in a area that's not ideal, as I wanted to keep my independence instead of leaving instantly or staying with people to cope. I  did slip up and beg him to come back the first night which he said no to.  He said he doesn't want to see me again or be with me ever again and that it's all my fault. He said to go be with other men and move on. I've re blocked him days ago and stuck to it, however I'm thinking of him constantly even while distracting myself. What hurts the most is how cold and nasty he is. That last time I spoke to him days ago he was nice for like one second when I told him about a pregnancy test then straight after went cold again. He asked what he could do to help, a said a phone call to discuss it and he said he simply doesn't want to do that because he just doesn't. Why even ask how he could help then? Why even leave me unblocked? I still blame myself for everything and I feel like the day I told him to leave and in general that i should have just kept my mouth shut. If he ever does call and tells me for example that he's not changed at all and that I can expect more abuse from him I'd literally still have him back which is completely insane and I do not want to be or think like that. Whatever point he is trying to make he's definitely made it. At this point I regret ever standing up to him. Feeling abandoned by him hurts more than the physical abuse. Keep in mind there was quiet a lot of physicial abuse throughout the last year and few months including strangulation from him, bruises, being hit, being thrown around like a ragdoll, and a lot more. When they say it's dangerous after seperation from your abuser I almost feel like it doesn't apply to me because he litterely wants nothing to do with me.

2699,My ex came over and coerced me into having sex then discarded me,"Me and my ex recently broke up because I caught him cheating with his ex. I’m trauma bonded to him though so it’s been hard to break away. Every time I get about a week out he comes back and forces us to stay connected. I say to him that I don’t want to have sex but we end up doing it anyway when he pushed himself on me.

This time, he came over and I told him I wanted to stop multiple times. I explained that I’m too emotional right now and need time to think. He’d stop for a minute then continue.

I was scared to tell him to stop because lately he’s been putting his hands around my neck and squeezing. I was a little suspicious but thought it was just a sex related thing. But today he started squeezing and picking me up and was grabbing my head the way you would when you want to snap somebody’s neck. Out of fear, I just started to get into it so he’d stop.

I’m conflicted because I feel used and left behind but I also need to remember that I left him and this was part of my plan. For me to get away from him while he’s distracted by somebody else. His ex is back in the picture so she can deal with this now. I hope she gets out too but she’s also been malicious to me and competing with me which has enabled his abuse.

2710,How to handle seeing my abusive ex,"So I've never posted or lurked or anything on this sub before, so bear with me, delete if not allowed, yada yada yada

It's been almost a year since I left my abusive ex.  In that time, I've gotten my own apartment, found a job I love, gotten a boyfriend who respects me, gone through therapy, and realized that what happened to me was abuse.  I guess I should say that my abuse was only emotional.  He didn't even remember to financially abuse me, so leaving him was a lot easier for me than it could've been.

My college reunion is coming up in a couple weeks.  My ex and I met in college, and his mom and my dad actually went to the same college, were friends there, and have been very active in the alumni community.  So me and my ex being together was a big deal.  There are alums who know nothing about me except that I'm this man's daughter and that I was engaged to this woman's son.  When we broke up, alums who I barely knew (but still liked) reached out to me saying that my ex and I were both good people and would both find happiness.

My ex isn't a good person.

My ex is going to be at reunions, and I'm dreading it.  I don't know if he's even going to try to talk to me or if he'll make a big deal out of me not talking to him, but that's the thing.  The worst part of our relationship was me not knowing if he was going to make a big deal out of something.  Was he going to fixate on this thing?  Was he going to decide that I was doing this little thing wrong and turn it into a massive fight?  The not knowing makes me feel like I'm being abused all over again.  I got out.  This isn't supposed to be happening anymore.  I have plans for what to do if he tries to make a big deal out of me not doing what he wants, and my dad and boyfriend will both be there to back me up, but the fact that I don't know if this will be a huge fight or not is killing me.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,no,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
2714,missing my abuser/ex??,"he abused me for so long. mentally, verbally, emotionally. i still remember sobbing everyday, begging him to stop being mean to me. begging him to be nice & begging him to tell me he loved me. just for him to tell me i had “no reason to cry”, followed by so many names and so much cursing. i still remember how he’d yell at me & curse me out every time i guy talked to me. i still remember how he’d punch the wall and break his closet door. i still remember how he would tell me he was going to **** himself if i left him. there are SO many bad memories. but there are also the memories from the very beginning, who i thought he was. the sweetest guy, the funniest guy. almost the male version of me as we had the exact same humor and taste in music. he knew he had me in his palm and he ruined me. after 2 years, i finally got out of it. i was so sad but then i felt better after about a month. i thought i was done with the “sad” phase. then i recently found out he has a new girlfriend. i haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. i’ve been crying every night. im missing him again. i miss his voice, i miss hearing him tell me he loves me. i know he was such a shitty person but i still miss him. i wonder if he ever thinks about me anymore. i wonder if her skin is softer than mine. i wonder if she makes him laugh more than i did. i wonder if she makes him happier than i did. i miss him and it’s killing me knowing he’s with someone new. i shouldn’t feel this way and i feel so stupid. how do i miss someone that called me so many names and cursed me out every night? how do i miss someone that gaslighted every single day? i’ve talked to my friends about this but they haven’t been through my situation, which is why i’m posting this on here. i hope one of you has been in my situation before and you have some kind of advice or encouraging words. i would really appreciate it :(",irrelevant,no,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,yes
2721,Does my abusive ex deserve to lose his friends? (PLEASE READ),"So some background info: I’m a sophomore in high school. (Going into my junior year) For privacy reasons, I am just going to call him Steve although that’s not his real name. Steve and I had the same friend group. Throughout our relationship, our friends remained friends with him but they would often tell me I needed to get out of the relationship because what was seen was bad enough. They told him many times when we all hung out that what he was doing wasn’t right. What they saw anyway. (Behind closed doors he was VERY abusive) Physical, emotional, sexual and mental abuse. I now have PTSD, and I am changing schools and also going to therapy. His friends checked in on me when we broke up and decided to cut contact with him, meaning they are no longer friends. One girl, who remains friends with him and who he also cheated on me with during the relationship (which I stayed btw) accused me of lying although I have texts of him calling me names and videos of him being extremely rough with me and friends who recall me calling them sobbing almost every night. According to the girl “He’s going through a rough time because a pretty white girl decided to lie and make him lose all his friends over false information.” None of the information is false. I have scars on my arms and legs from self harm from feeling trapped in that relationship. I am a very forgiving person although he has not apologized or asked for forgiveness. I have a big heart. But part of me is so happy that he lost all of his friends. He put me through hell and what I went through will effect me for the rest of my life. He deserves it, right? But part of me feels terrible because although it’s not my fault he lost his friends (his friends decided not to be friends with him anymore) what he did to me doesn’t define him, right? Or does it? Just like my scars and what I went through doesn’t define me, what he put me through doesn’t define him either right? (I would like to add that although it was not as severe, he was abusive to his ex girlfriend) She has helped me tremendously since we both went through the same thing (in a sense) and with the same person. I just don’t exactly know how to feel and I know it’s up to me to decide how I feel but I would just really appreciate some feedback and opinions.

2724,Ghost from past abuse - I found out an abusive ex replaced me soon after our break up,"I’m in the process of healing from a recent end of an abusive relationship. That wasn’t my first though. 

I couldn’t sleep last night, so I made the dumbest decision to look up people from my past on social media. Found another abusive ex and his current partner’s Instagram accounts. They seem so happy. And that hurt. I know Instagram is not always realistic, but they still seem pretty stable and content. 
We were only together for a few months. We met abroad where we were both foreigners. And we had only dated less than a month before I went back to my country. We decided he would move to my country to give it a go (I know. It was stupid and embarrassing. I barely knew him). As soon as he arrived, I guess he realized how impulsive his move was and regretted  the decision and became mean and disrespectful to me. I was surprised with his quick change of heart and insisted he stayed. 
I know there were so many dumb mistakes from my part. But that doesn’t justify his bullying. He would lash out at me, call me fat and just straight up disrespect me. After two horrible months, he left and we never talked again. 
Then last night I found out he’s been with the same girl since a few weeks after he left my country. It’s hard not to wonder how he was capable of being abusive to me and be nice to someone else. They’ve been together for like 6 years. I mean, that’s a long time. 😣
It’s not like I had strong feelings for him. I never really had the time to develop them. But he left me a wreck feeling abused and worthless. One of the meanest things he said before he left was “hooking up with an Asian was cool (I’m Asian), I’m gonna try that again”. And of course, his gf is Asian. It just seems a bit too planned, or it’s just me trying to convince myself their relationship is weird. 
Still. It seems unfair that he left me confused and hurt and he just got on with his life, he’s happy with a new gf and no one knows how shitty he was to me. 
I know I shouldn’t  torture myself by looking for exes online. I still feel worthless though.

3105,My past abusive relationships are messing with my new healthy relationship,"I have been in two abusive relationships. One when I was 15 and then one after some years. First bf was 7 years older than me, second one was 17 years older. The first one was physical abuse, he was pathological jealous, controlling and he would call me ugly and old looking and that nobody could love me like he could and the second one was verbal abuse telling me I was mentally ill, crazy and nobody would be able to me with me. 

I know it might sound like I also had abusive or neglectful parents when I was small, but I didn’t. I had secure attachment with my parents growing up, never been put down or spanked. Except from a traumatic experience when I was 6 with my dad getting 6 that’s it. But that experience cause me to develop OCD (never got meds) and it went away after some years. Most of it was obsessions and compulsions to that people would stay themselves (maybe because I felt I didn’t have control when I saw my dad changing and OCD was a way for me to gain control over change). 

But these two relationships have messed with my head. 

I have dated a lot guys, a lot of good guys since. I was thinking I was fine, but it also never got that deep. 

Now I am in the most healthy relationship I have ever been in, with a man that’s my age mate. We have been together for almost one year and the longer we have been together the more I notice my insecurities and unhealed wounds I didn’t think I had. 

Fx. If I think in my head that his mood changes then I start to pull away and think if he his annoyed with me. 

I am bad at communicating negative emotions. I scare to sound too negative, stuck in the past, too dramatic, too oversharing or sound like I think I am the only one who had something happen to me when many people have it way worse.

I am still really scared of people suddenly changing. Him getting tired of me, loosing attraction to me etc. 

I compare myself a lot to other girls, and scared of being old and loosing my value to him (logically I know it is not how it works and he never gave me reason to believe this).

I don’t know how to get over it and it has starting to cause me a lot of anxiety in my relationship these past couple of months.

Right now, I am currently at his house for one more day and then he will let me go back to my house tomorrow afternoon. 

Backstory: He was an ex-marine and he’s manipulative and abusive to me. He has controlled me through everything such as body shaming, taking all my birth controls, taking all my anti depressants, demands sex all the time even when I’m sick or uncomfortable. Recently, my childhood dog of 15 years of age has been going in and out of vet visits. I have been stressed out because she’s dying and he won’t let me go home to take care of her. He’s accusing me of acting childish when I am worried sick about my dog. 

I have no one to talk to so please tell me exactly what I need to do to get out, how, and when.

UPDATE: I did it. I left. It was traumatizing. He continued to praise himself, accusing me for everything, demanding repayment for all the dates we went on, and call me stupid while he throws my belongings outside.

3124,Can an abusive relationship impact all future relationships even with therapy?,"
I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post. 

7 years ago, I was in an emotionally and verbally abusive relationship for 3 years. It turned my entire world upside down to the point I was unrecognisable. Physically, and in my studies and life path. It broke me. 

I hadn’t had relationships prior to this, so I am not sure if it would have been this way regardless. Any fling/casual encounter/dating I had prior to my abusive ex was not like this. They were pretty “normal” - if anything I lost interest and didn’t cling on. 

However, all of my following relationships were unhealthy. I was extremely insecure and terrified of abandonment and pushed away men I even dated for a short time acting out. 

The two longer term relationships were full of arguments and both of those men treated me badly and cheated on me. Regrettably I stayed with the second and even went on to have a child with him, and here I am as a mother still feeling quite broken inside though full of love for my son. I am still with him and though things are superficially okay, it is not the relationship I envisioned. 

I didn’t leave the relationships even when I was miserable and it was toxic. I clung on which I hugely regret. 

I don’t wish to absolve myself of blame. I will be open that I couldn’t regulate my emotions well and acted very insecure - mostly with the men I dated briefly. I may well have pushed them away. I would say I exhibited borderline traits. 

I feel the answer may be therapy. However I have been to three separate therapists - all of whom felt there was nothing “wrong” with me and instead it was the relationship itself. We spoke about the relationships and processed them but I never felt different as a person. Still insecure with low self worth. 

I do question whether I had the best experiences with my therapists however, especially as I did not want to change and was very deeply involved in my situations. 

My question is - can these be symptoms of a post abusive relationship? I do feel sad and a great sense of mourning over how I feel my life should have gone.

3125,Worries in new relationship.,"I used to be in an abusive relationship for 3 years.

That was my first relationship and to say that it destroyed me mentally, physically and emotionally would be an understatement.

It tok me several tries to finally be free.

I spent the next year trying to build myself up and heal, but I still hold the scars of that relationship within me.

I met someone a year after and he is the opposite of abusive; very sweet and kind, and I have only seen green flags from him. I know people can hide who they really are but I deeply observed him and don't believe he has any bad intention towards me whatsoever. He treats me with kindness and respect.

Now, I have always had trust issues, and my past relationship exacerbated that. 

My ex had betrayed me, cheated a couple times. 

That left a mark, and sometimes I find myself worrying that my current partner is going to cheat on me too. Or sometimes I have a strong gut feeling that I got betrayed; and I have no indication that he did. It deeply annoys me because there is a higher chance he hasn't done anything, and I am just sabotaging things with my worries. But in my past relationship, every gut feeling I had was justified and I somehow found out he did things behing my back.

3138,Struggling with new relationship after abuse,"Hello everyone, about 8 months ago I left my verbally, mentally, emotionally, physically and sexually abusive ex. He has caused me so much trauma but I finally found the strength to leave after mentally checking out for 6 months while I was still with him. He cheated on me relentlessly, pressured me into having sex, got physical when he was upset, screamed and called me every name in the book as well as lots of gaslighting. I’ve started dating someone new a few months ago and now i’m questioning if that was the right choice. He knew I had just left an abusive relationship and somewhat knew the extent of abuse, he assured me he would be there with me through my healing journey, which is one of the main reasons I decided to take a chance with him. He’s great in a lot of aspects, however a lot of things he does reminds me of my ex. I’m really sensitive about other women after being cheated on so many times and instead of reassuring me he tells me i’m overreacting. He says me needing constant reassurance is annoying. He has a bit of a temper but has never yelled at me but I can tell he wants to yell when frustrated. This week his friends from out of town came and he’s been completely mia, out til 3-4 am with no call or text or update and he says sharing a location is too controlling. He also ditched me for NYE to be with his friends. My guts saying something is up but i know it’s probably just my trauma and trust issues. I don’t know if it’s him or is it just my trauma and trust issues. I’m also considering if I should break up with him and just heal on my own. I really love him and love our connection but I just don’t want to go through what I went through again. 

TLDR: Left a very abusive relationship and started a new one recently. I keep getting triggered in the new relationship and wondering if it’s him or just my trauma, and if I should leave him or not. 

P.S I am currently in therapy but not sure how much it’s helping.",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
3139,I seek out abusive relationships,"I’m not sure if this is an okay place to put this. If not, sorry in advance. 

I like to be abused. I know that sounds crazy (maybe it is) but I obviously recognize how horrible it is. I know they’re horrible and the effects are horrible. Traumatizing. I mean *ive* been traumatized from abuse. I recognize all of that. 

But for some reason I find myself constantly seeking people out like this. And not subconsciously. I mean literally. I met this guy and there were instant signs that he’s a potential abuser. I mean love bombing, immediately and overly possessive, wanting to change me, angry, no accountability, etc. And, I hate to admit, but it’s the only reason I got into a relationship with him. I was like excited (both sexually and regularly) by the potential. Every time he exhibited traits (especially new things or an escalation) I would get a thrill out of it. Sometimes I would even do or say things I thought would make him react negatively just to see if he would do anything. And it *has* been escalating. And sometimes, especially when he’s making me cry and threatening me if I leave or stuff with money, I hate it. And I hate him. And I want to leave. (I know I have to). But outside of those moments where I’m scared and upset, I go back to being thrilled/excited/turned on by it. 

He’s started to do small physical things (pinching, lightly punching, etc) and it leaves bruises and I take pictures of them and feel thrilled. It’s like I think they’re pretty or something. I feel, not *cool*, but idk how else to describe it. It’s like I like being the victim. It almost makes me feel sexy? Feminine?

It also makes me feel like a little girl sometimes (I’m 23f, he’s 35m) and I like that. Especially when he’s talking to me like I’m stupid or chastising me. 

I didn’t have the best or most normal childhood. I have multiple mental health related diagnosis. I have previous trauma. And there are times when I am scared. Or angry. Or upset at myself. Or feel pathetic. And it’s not even like I love this man. There’s something wrong with me and I’m wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this?

3144,Facing the Reality of Ending a 5-Year Relationship,"Im struggling…

I (21F) am leaving my (21M) partner of 5 years. 

A few days ago I drove home after a great day and came home to have my partner grumpy and unhappy with my performance doing the weekly food shop. After driving home over an hour on a hot summers day the food had got a bit warm and some icecream had spilt into my car, now I’m the worst person ever. Insults on my success with my career and studies, my family, my looks and after I was upset by his words kept going and going.

This has opened my eyes. This isn’t the first time. Usually I’ve just blocked it out, almost forgotten? But now the vail over my eyes has arisen and I don’t want to be around him anymore. 

Since then I’ve made steps in getting help from family, friends, domestic violence assistance, mostly emotionally this far. I’ve also told his parents so he can get some help from them as he doesn’t think I’m being serious yet after telling him multiple times. 

I’m really struggling with the fact that I’ve made this decision, but I’ve locked myself into it through getting help and telling his parents. I feel so sick in the stomach. 

It’s as if I don’t think about it for a while feeling in denial that I’m leaving him, realising it’s happening and going into a hole of regret and guilt. I’m realising I’m going through the stages of grief… right now denial.

This is definitely not the first time I’ve felt this way (wanting to leave him). I would say I’ve almost felt it 4 of the 5 years we’ve been together. But the confirmation has come to a tipping point and I’m actually doing it and I’m so scared. 

I can’t understand that I’ve made this decision and that it’s happening like I literally CANT go back. I want to hug him and say sorry but I can’t do it. I can’t do it. I can not do it. I want it all to go away. Like just have him poof into thin air and never see him again.

3147,dating after an abusive relationship?,"i (23f) was in an abusive relationship two years ago, physically and mentally abusive. i’ve done a lot of healing in these two years, spent time alone, and took the time to care for myself. but i would be lying if i said to this day i don’t think about it everyday, because it unfortunately still haunts me. and it’s made me into someone who’s afraid of kindness and compassion, and that’s not really a fun feeling.

i’ve started seeing someone for the first time in two years, he is so nice to me, he seems like he cares and he clearly really likes me, we have mutual friends and they all have nothing but great things to say. and i truly like him, i haven’t felt this way in so long. but i am so scared, i have even mentioned to him how nice he is, and how it does make me nervous (to which he seemed shocked… rightfully so i suppose.) it’s actually quite sad how afraid i am of someone being so nice to me. (in a genuine, non-love bombing way!) i have a rule for myself that i will not tell him (or anyone i date) that i’ve been abused until it’s serious, as i don’t want to give men the feeling that they can get away with much more, if that makes sense? i also fear being pitied or looked down upon. 

i need advice on how to move forward, im excited to finally feel this way for someone again, and i don’t want to ruin anything. i am a sweet girl i think, i have lots of love to give , but i fear that my trauma might make things hard for me. i just want to experience love again",irrelevant,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,no,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

3152,Commitment issues from toxic relationship,"I broke up with my abusive boyfriend over a year ago and I still panic at the thought of being in a relationship. My ex boyfriend (we dated senior year of HS) was so isolating that a lost a lot of friends and lost myself in the relationship. He yelled at me for my outfits, curling my hair, compulsively insecure, and also got me pregnant because he would get mad if I wouldn’t have sex and then I had an abortion (in secret) which still deeply hurts me. I came to college and we broke up and I was so happy and decided that being single was best for me. Somehow, I ended up in this situationship with a great guy who really loves me. I’ve been essentially dating the sweetest boy on earth for like 9 months, but I can’t call it a relationship. We are officially exclusive but I won’t let him tell people we’re dating. They know we’re involved, obviously. I feel horrible, and I make up things in my head to justify it but I just know it’s breaking him. All he wants is a title, but I convince myself that I have feelings for other guys still or overall just panic and want to end things with him every time he raises the topic of dating. The saddest part is that he’s losing patience with me. He has been by my side despite me doing so much to push him away, but he has been persuing me for like 11 months and I still won’t date. What do I do? How do I let go of the past? Why can’t I? I have this fear of going back to being “x’s girlfriend” who let a boy walk all over her. I even said yes ones and started almost hyperventilating on the spot! And I don’t like to be tied to anyone I like to be my own person and make my own decisions. I literally refuse to be “controlled” in any way even when it’s reasonable relationship expectations. I really love him, it’s just something about the label that really scares me.

3154,I got out of an abusive relationship.,"I got out of an abusive relationship recently with the help of my family. I had tried to break up with my ex two days before my parents took me from my apartment. For TWO HOURS my ex begged me not to leave, and I was exhausted by the time those 2 hours were up (I was pregnant for a second time and didn’t know it,) I kind of just gave up, said fine, we’re still together. The next day I found out I was pregnant and I said we could work on things. The day after that was when the cops were called and showed up to my apartment while my ex’s mom was there after dropping off our baby. My parents and I frantically packed stuff and left once the cops had gone. 
I have gotten a restraining order against him. 
Today it was dismissed because I didn’t say that his “God, I want to beat you” comment, and the fact he drove 110 miles or any other time he drove fast with me in the car was within the past 180 days. It all was.

3157,Stage of grief from the relationship,"Is anybody else dealing the stages of the grief from leaving their relationship?

 When my husband kidnapped myself & our kids, I know I was denial until he verbally snapped on me in front of the kids. I started bargaining with God to help make it through & then I would leave him. I would pray to God to just give me 1 yr & then I would leave, then it went to 6 months & then I would leave. Finally it was “until I got a job & saved enough to support myself & the kids then I would leave”. Eventually I just had to accept that it wasn’t any good staying with him when he refused to work & didn’t want me to work. 
Since I started therapy after leaving him & moving back home with my mom. I was angry & depressed, using my coping methods I noticed I was less angry & more depressed; by still attending therapy I was diagnosed with ptsd & prescribed with Zoloft. Although of my diagnosises (not sure if that’s the plural version) are still there it’s not as loud in my head as it used to be. I say all that to say now I just want answers from him. Like “What was the reason for raping me?”, “Why were you so cruel to me when I just wanted to love you?” and etc. 
 Knowing I want answers from him & also knowing that I’ll never get the truth from him. I’m okay with it & just ready to get on with my life.

Last night he was tracking me while i was out with my friend and got really angry at me for going to a bar I hadn’t previously told him about. Today he’s just been terrifying and shouting at me until I cry and then shouting at me more for crying. He says he’s sick of me crying every day but he’s causing it?

3161,First relationship after leaving abuser,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this. So I left my abuser 6 years ago. He was a very physically and emotionally abusive man. In that time I've done a lot of healing, but still have more to do. In those 6 years I avoided men like the plague though. Then I met someone by accident. He is a good man, but I think I messed it up with him. There are trauma responses and triggers that hadn't really shown up since I swore off relationships. I trusted him and was more open with him about my past trauma than I've been with anyone else including my friends and family. I guess I thought doing that would help him understand if I got triggered and tried to push him away, had trouble communicating, and had difficulty showing emotions. I tried not to do those things, but when I messed up and had a trauma response I apologized right away and tried to explain why. But I think I pushed him away for the last time since he's stopped communicating. I think the hardest thing is knowing I hurt him that bad
My question is though why does emotional pain hurt so much worse? Like if I could trade in the heart break and emotional pain for a beating I would in an instant.

3162,Unexpected trigger in my safe relationship (TW sexual violence/coercion),"Currently in my (25f) first safe ((so far)) relationship. He (25m) gave me hickies and I’m having a hard time. 
Hickies were once a way to control what I wore/what I did. They began as something that would happen (naturally, I thought) during sex & then became a way to limit my autonomy. Regarding sex, abusers rarely asked for consent or had conversations with me about things before doing them. Don’t get me wrong, there is something to be said for spontaneity during sex but it was intrusive & uncomfy. So, I am equating these hickies to how my abusers used them and waiting for these same tactics to come out.
My current partner is very concerned with my well being. We have extensive conversations about what we want from our sex life. For the most part we are in sync/open to explore. He won’t ever give me a hickie again if I don’t want him to. The problem is, I genuinely like hickies & feel sad that it could potentially be something we give up. It’s a sexual pleasure we share and to think that it’s causing such cognitive dissonance for me just sucks.. I’m feeling a little insane. I don’t understand how in the moment I love it but when I look in the mirror after/the next day & see them, I go back to that abused woman whose only proof of the abuse were the bruises. I guess it puts me in that headspace and I have to remind myself that I am safe now. It’s so hard. Any encouragement or advice while I’m working through this is greatly appreciated.

3168,Healing from an Abusive Relationship,"Today is an interesting day for me. July 3, 2019 is the day my life permanently changed it's trajectory, it's the day that I met my ex. Looking back on that day, I remember being so giddy and full of joy and positive anxiety wondering where things would go. I remember making plans to hang out, and then actually going on our first date and how ridiculously easy it was. What was only supposed to be a couple hour thing turned into me staying at his apartment until 3am despite having to work at 7am because the conversation was just so organic and flowing so easily. I remember him telling me to text him when I got home because it was late, and I had a half hour drive ahead of me. And I remember waking up the next morning to a text from him making sure I got home safe.

But, I also remember the weeks following our first date when he went off the grid and we didn't talk. I remember wondering how a first date could go so well just for him to ghost me. I remember sending one last Hail Mary text to see if I could get him to bite, and then actually getting a response. What young, naïve Sam didn't realize at that time was that was the first red flag. I should have never sent that last text, after an entire week of no communication I should've went my own way and never looked back.

I've learned so many lessons, and done so many things because I made the decision 3 years ago to let my ex into my life, and I don't regret it at all. Everything I've gone through I had to go through so I could see the bigger picture, and grow as a person. Sure, had I not started talking to him I wouldn't be a victim of DV, but I also wouldn't be able to say I've travelled the country. I wouldn't be able to say that I've experienced what it feels like to love someone so intensely that you'd do anything to make sure they're happy and comfortable.

Any hint of annoyance from him (not towards me, just in general), I get extremely uncomfortable. He knows all of this, comforts me or will leave the room (for example, if he has a stressful work call and gets a stern tone). I've found myself becoming very defensive and lashing out verbally at a perceived threat that just isn't there.

I really don't want to push him away. He handles situations exactly how I've always wanted, even if I'm lashing out, the most he'll do is walk away to give me space.

Maybe it didn’t affect her as much but watching my mother be beat; going with her to Walmart in the middle of the night to get foundation to cover her black eye. Having to call the police on my father.

3218,I think I am in an abusive relationship,"Me (19F) and my husband (21M) have been together since March of 2019. We got married in October of last year (a few months after finding out I was pregnant). Yea I know that things moved really quickly. Anyways, when we argue he is always very aggressive and very confrontational. I don’t like to continue the conversation when he gets like that. Instead I will just refuse to keep arguing and walk away. On many occasions he has put his hands on me as I’ve tried to walk away, with tonight being the most recent. Tonight as I walked away he grabbed all of my hair and yanked me towards him. Then he wrestled me in a chokehold and slammed me into the couch. I tried to bite him so he would let me go. Whenever something like this happens I never think “This is abuse.” It’s always afterwards when I sit down and really think about it. I guess since he didn’t give me a black eye or cause a lot of pain it takes a while to sink in. After it happened I told him it wasn’t ok and he told me that he was just trying to grab me by my shoulders and blah blah. He says he snatched me back because he wanted to finish watching tv with me. He kind of forced me to stay there and watch the show because we had planned to spend that time together. I wasn’t ready to open up and talk to him but tomorrow I’m telling him that if he touches me again I’m leaving him. Our son is 6 months now and I just started working again. I have no money so I want to save up just in case I really do have to leave him so me and my son can get our own apartment. I plan on having the conversation about the abuse through text messages just so I can have proof of him admitting to it just in case I do leave him and he wants to take me to court over custody. I love him so I hope it doesn’t come down to that but I know I need to have a plan. We are in the bed right now and he is sleeping; I couldn’t fall asleep.

3222,This subreddit is the reason I escaped my abusive relationship,"And probably saved my life....


On May 19th, 2018 my ex beat and strangled me. It was the worst physical abuse I had endured since I met him. 
In the middle of it all, I thought “who is going to find my body?” And “what is going to happen to my son?”

Through questions I googled, I found this subreddit. Two weeks later, I made this account and first post. 

Before finding this, I didn’t know that abuse could be emotional. 
I didn’t know what a narcissist was. 
I didn’t know what trauma bonding was.
I didn’t know that I wasn’t alone. 

I had so many questions. 
In the end, all the answers told me the same thing: Leave. Run. 
I felt like they were being over dramatic 
- “they don’t know what situation I’m in”, “they don’t know my boyfriend. He could be different” “Run? Where am I going to go?”

I checked this sub everyday. I contacted the DV hotline. I downloaded books about manipulation and Narc-abuse. I took assessments online to rate the severity of the situation I was in. 
I just couldn’t stand to believe I was truly in an abusive relationship. 
I thought my boyfriend was just mean and hot-tempered. 
I thought it was my fault. 

I didn’t think my family would understand. I didn’t think I’d be able to move past the break-up, let alone having to be the one to leave him. 

Do you relate?

By coming to this subreddit, you’re already one step ahead of so many others who are struggling with being in/leaving their situation. 

As of today I am in the process of pressing felony charges against my ex-abuser. 
In light of all the emotional and physical warfare I went through in the past, I have gained an enormous amount of self love and respect. 

Take in the stories.... listen to the questions.... but most of all, pay attention to the advice. 

I know it’s not easy to leave. Whether you’re trapped financially, emotionally, or physically scared for your life, it’s possible. You’re not alone!

God Bless all of you reading this right now 💜
I hope you’re able to make it out

3226,Feeling fed up and maybe wanting out of the relationship,"I posted on here about a month ago about my problems. I guess this is an update and me needing validation/support (little bit of both) last time I posted on here I talked about the physical and emotional abuse. Well he did it again. Literally a week after my last post, he tried to choke me because I refused to help him change our sons dirty diaper (he went #2). And then I think it was 2 days before I was induced we got into an argument about how he felt like it was my fault he wasnt working out and was upset all the time, and of course me being me I got super upset and told him it wasnt fair for him to be blaming me and I kept telling him that and he would just say ok ok leave me alone, but of course I felt dismissed so I got upset and he ended up punched me in the face several times because I wouldnt leave him alone... and then he tried to push in my eyes. I think  I'm so angry at myself for not saying anything because now he's on deployment and he's being emotionally abusive. He says he hates me he says f* you he calls me the b word.. its horrible . And let me tell you guys this is all 3 weeks postpartum after he was with me for our daughters birth and the doctors told us I essentially could've died from the emergency c-section because of how much blood I lost (I'm still dealing with that trauma) sorry for this horrible update I know it must bother some.
But all this to say I'm finally getting fed up. I'm slowly starting to see how emotionally he isnt there for me and doesnt even try to be. I dont feel loved or appreciated and I really feel like he doesnt respect me. I feel like part of me stays one because I'm terrified of not getting full custody of the kids (I dont want him in our lives at all), two because I feel like if we do split up he'll paint me to be the bad guy or the one who didnt try and I dont know why but I care a lot if he goes around saying I was the problem in the marriage. But I'm slowly wanting to let him go.

Ironically I'm meeting up with friends (they both work from home so please dont criticize me about covid) tomorrow. Do you guys think I should tell them what's going on? Should I ask them to help me be able to divorce my husband (more of the emotional and hand holding support)

3229,For those of you who fell victim to an abusive relationship: was there an uneasy feeling at the beginning of the relationship that you dismissed?,"There was once an expert on abusive relationships whose name I can’t remember on Oprah who said that most women who end up in an abusive relationship report a feeling of unease which they felt early on in the relationship but suppressed. I personally met my abuser at a bar in a group setting, we started to chat, got along and he asked for my contact. I happily gave it to him and heard from him the very next day. By this point, nothing bad had happened and I was excited for our next meeting. That afternoon I went on a walk and suddenly I felt this immense unease in my stomach which somehow felt connected to this man. I brushed it off as paranoia/hangover from the night before. A couple of weeks after that, we met for the second time, this time one on one, and it went really well, we said our goodbyes in a good mood and he texted me soon after. No later than the next day I felt literally nauseous and super uneasy about him but only for about 10 minutes and then it went away. I was considering calling our next meeting off but then the feeling went away and once again I dismissed it. Now I know this was my intuition. In my defense, I was only 22 and quite lonely at this time and he was the older, charismatic guy I was hoping for. But I will never dismiss my intuition like that again.

3231,I think i’m in an abusive relationship,"I’m 30f, she’s 29f. Most of the times, things are fantastic. It’s been almost 4 years, and when things are good, they’re fine.

It’s when she gets upset. Typically her period causes her emotions to get very out of whack. This is not something I have decided for myself, her doctor has tried to put her on BC, as she feels it will help, but she refuses to take them, stating they make her feel numb.

When we fight, the blowouts are huge. It’s a whole day affair, usually I will have to call into work because she won’t let me leave. She has never hit me, but I constantly feel like I have to walk on egg shells around her, and when she gets upset she’ll punch other things around her, usually the wall or table.

I love her, this isn’t the person I fell in love with, and after we fight she always promises to change, or try medication, or anything, and nothing ever changes.

My life just feels like i’m putting out matches she lights before she lights a fire, and I don’t know, maybe this is normal? I don’t want to just walk away, a part of me feels like this can still be saved. Any advice would be appreciated.

3236,my past abuse is interfering with my relationship,"A bit of context; from late 2019 to late 2020 (1 year 3 months) i was in an abusive relationship with constant cheating, lying, hitting, r@ping, sexu@l @ssult, etc. it was a living nightmare and left lots of trauma and damage. i have nightmares, mood swings, major triggers, etc. that i have not gotten past. I just recently got into another relationship (9 months so far) and we always seem to butt heads. i’ve had multiple conversations with him about my triggers and traumas and how i need him to be patient. I’m not rude or a horrible girlfriend, i just need a little more patience when it comes to things like sexual acts or even being touched. He doesn’t seem to understand or try to work with me on things. He loves dark humor which you can already see where this is going. R@pe jokes. he makes them all the time which always triggers me and upsets me. He won’t compromise on solutions or ways we can work things out when i’m feeling down and struggling. Especially when it comes to sex. if he wants it, we do it. if i’m not feeling up to it, he accuses me of cheating without even considering that i’m having a hard time or that i’m not in the mood.

3245,Has anybody else noticed that the types of movies/shows they want are very similar to the types of relationships they end up in?,"Per my previous posts, I’m in a narcissistic abusive relationship. I’m currently in the post discard phase where he’s trying to keep me on the hook but is going off to do his own things. It’s only been a few days and it’s already starting. He just refuses to let me go.

When he came over today I realized that I’d have to completely disappear and not say where I’m going. Then it reminded me of one of my favorite movies, Safe Haven. This movie is about a young woman who is running from her abusive husband and moves to some small town and falls in love with a nice man.

My other favorite is The Time Traveler’s Wife. It’s about a young woman who’s been best friends with a time traveler since she was 6 and falls in love with him. She was basically groomed but it wasn’t entirely intentional because the first time he met her she was an adult. But basically in one line of the movie she says “You always knew this would happen. I never had a choice!”

That’s basically how I feel in this relationship. He always knew he was an abuser but I didn’t. I wasn’t given a choice.

But I say all this to say that a lot of my favorite romance movies and tv couples are about abusive, complicated relationships. Meredith x Derek are another example. Derek is clearly a narcissist.

I feel like I should try to reprogram my mind by watching relationships that are less chaotic.

3251,Is it just me? I feel so disappointed in myself. Possible TW abusive in all ways former relationship.,"I ""survived"" a 9.5 year long abusive relationship. I had a horrible childhood but rebuilt myself, kids can, they're strong. But this relationship broke me. It broke my soul. That's something we should never let anyone take, but he did. I know the exact time and event that did it. I recall it every single of every minute.

It was abusive in everyway but lucky me never had the typical cycle, he never apologised and there was never the build up. He just did whenever he wanted to. Forced sex mostly.

He is now going through court for some of the heinous things he did. I have been ""free"" for 5 years and 7 months. From the outside it would appear that I have moved on with my life. But I really haven't. I am alome because I am frightened. I am unemployed (despite having the skills and qualifications) because I have no self esteem to apply for jobs and zero confidence in myself that I could actually do them.

I am stagnate. Because he broke me and I don't even know what or who I am anymore.

I'm not depressed. Yes I have PTSD but this but this is not that. I am alone, but that's it, I'm not living because I literally don't know how to converse with with other adults. I come across weird, I know because they've told me so. I can't make or keep friends. I'm a loser basically.

3253,Been cycling through the 7 stages of grieving my abusive relationship for 6 years. I finally have come to acceptance and never want to get back together.,"
I recently got out of a very emotionally abusive relationship that I had been in off and on for the last 6+ years. We are currently living together because he refuses to move out so now I have to pack my life up once again and find somewhere to live. 

Processing being abused and accepting it has been such a strange emotional ride. Some days I’m joyous- dancing and singing to my favorite empowering songs. Some days I cry because of the years of my life that I’ve lost to this man that I let have power over my life. Some days I’m angry because I let this go on for so long and why did I have to have rose-colored glasses?

I was in denial that his outbursts and choices to ignore me for days were abuse. I was in denial that he was emotionally controlling me. I believed all his lies that I was the problem and started to doubt myself as a person. I turned to alcohol as something to numb my sad thoughts until I hit rock bottom almost got a DUI, ruined my relationship with my parents and gained 30lbs. 

I started to tell people that he broke up with me -which he did on a regular basis but I never told people when he did. I started sleeping in my own bed and stopped cleaning up after him. I felt like I finally took a stand in my life for myself again. I built up the courage and asked him to move out and told him that he has been verbally abusing me.

He’d been fired from his previous church for stalking a female student. (I didn’t know until later). When he met me he zeroed in on me and I flirted with the idea of dating him but he REALLY wasn’t my type. No dating or any kind of physical affection happened up to this point. He got fired from my church when the staff realized he was showing too much interest in me. I cut him off bc it seemed creepy. He stalked me at the church and blew up my phone. (It wasn’t so easy to block people back then). I was doing fine avoiding him until his mom called me and said I had betrayed him and his entire family and told me I needed to apologize. I felt like a horrible human being and did what she said. Him and his family made me feel obligated to whatever kind of relationship he wanted with me or else I was horrible human. I went on to marry him and have two kids with him, all the while constantly trying to break it off but he would chase me and hold me against my will until I broke down and apologized. Obviously we had sex and the appearance of a relationship. But if I was coerced into the relationship over and over for years was ANY of it consent? How do I define that relationship?

He's not love bombing like he used to after an extra abusive period. He's not making any effort whatsoever. I'm still expected to SERVE HIM. Literally bring him food, drinks, and coffee in bed.

He acts like he doesn't even notice that I refuse to touch him or talk to him unless it's about necessary things. Either our son sleeps between us, or nights when it's just us, I put my huge body pillow between us.

I (35 f) left my emotionally abusive partner (38 m) of 8.5 years back in February of this year. The grief was so painful it physically hurt. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life, hands down.

I moved back home closer to family and rent my own apartment currently. It’s Saturday morning and I’m in my bed, listening to gentle music, looking at my pictures I chose of the people I love up on my wall. I have my coffee on my bedside table and a really good book on my lap. 

I sit here feeling peace in my soul. And I am so grateful that I chose myself, and chose peace. Now that I know I can and will choose myself, I can’t stop thinking to myself “thank you, I love you”. 

I share this for everyone who is living with constant chaos, confusion, and heartache because they are in the midst of an abusive relationship. It’s not easy to leave and I understand it’s often not safe. But if you ever find a way to do so, please know, there can be peace and a better life for you on the other side of the heartache. And if you choose yourself, you may find you are eternally grateful to YOU. I felt selfish at first for leaving. And now all I can think is that I’m so grateful that I had the opportunity to pick me.

I was frustrated and annoyed since he demanded the food be done fast while I'm trying to watch a baby.
He texts me about how bad my behavior is etc. I told him the way a normal husband would handle this situation, he doesn't care, threatens to kick me out tells me I should shut up and think about the consequences of being a single mother. Comes down later and tells me how dare I talk to him this way, how there is no love in the marriage anymore, how horrible of a mother I am, how horrible of a wife I am, tells me to plan for separation, etc. Threatens to kick me out right there if I don't apologize right there. Nothing escalated to the levels it usually does but I was surprised he admitted this. Also turns out he ordered food even though he demanded I make food. He said since I'm so lazy, I should spend all my spare time planning meals since me working a full-time job and taking care of my daughter all day by myself isn't ""real work"" since it doesn't pay the bills and I'm so dumb and lazy I don't deserve free time.",yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,yes,cannot be inferred
3519,"I ""didn't love him enough""","I was seriously sick and had to be in a hospital for some time. During that time I wasn't able to have visitors besides my family or my phone so all communication happened through my sister who kept him updated on my health condition.   
After I was released, I found out I was blocked everywhere and he cut all ties. A few days ago he unblocked me proceeded to tell me he doesn't want me anymore as he cannot trust me anymore because I never showed him enough love. During an 18 month ""relationship"" I was apparently never loving enough. Mind you, I was always there for him during this emotionally and verbally abusive relationship in which he demanded all my attention always, I wasn't allowed to share an office with men otherwise he wouldn't talk to me, I was allowed to go out but it was always followed by him throwing a fit etc. Nothing was either ever really his fault or he admitted his mistakes but it was followed by intense breakdowns and him always telling me to leave him because he didn't ""deserve me"". I stuck with him through thick and thin because I thought it'd always get better. To be honest, I do sometimes have a problem showing my affection to people in big gestures but whenever he expressed he didn't feel loved enough by me, I was willing to give my everything to convince him otherwise. I gave him all my time and energy and love. And now he justifies him leaving me out of sudden by saying I never loved him enough. Mind you, a couple weeks back he told me he never felt so loved and cared for by anyone ever. So I don't know what to make of it.

I knew this relationship was toxic and abusive. So in a way, I should be relieved, right? Bu his words hit and cut really deep. I feel empty because I gave my everything. He also very carefully chose his words when saying nobody ever loved me more than he did and it was enough. He told me he gave me his everything and it wasn't enough to make me love him enough. He also told me he needed to put himself first and be loved by people who will love him enough and leave me behind. 

So now I am here terrified nobody will ever love me, nobody will ever think I am enough, that my love is enough. I feel so empty and I don't know what to do.

he had been actively trying to get me back since the last assault and this weekend he would not let me leave his place or pick up the phone because he wanted us to still be together but did not want my mother to know. When my mom could not reach me for hours, she called the police.

When the police came I think he finally realized he did not want to get himself into this much trouble. We went back to my place to make explanations to the police. he left not long after, saying it was over. before he left he said if i hadnt told my mother about the assault our love would be saved.

3525,“If you loved me than you would want me to feel good”,"He would say that anytime I wasn’t in the mood to give him head or have sex. “You literally don’t have to do anything but lay there” he would say. I guess that’s true I thought. But there were times I didn’t want him to have sex with me because we would be camping & id not have access to a shower or if I was on my period or sick. One time I was so sick with the flu & he just started having sex with me … than said he was comforting me? Who thinks I would want sex when I’m sick with the flu? Or when I’m crying about something I’m opening up about & he tries to have sex with me to “comfort me”. Those are times I wanted to say no. 

I was deeply afraid to flat out say no so instead I just hope he would be quick. When he wasn’t, I would ask if he’s”almost done” …. Just trying to express my internal experience. & I remember one time he scorned me afterwards so badly by screaming that he has to think of someone else just so he could cum because I’m such a horrible girlfriend for asking if he’s almost done while he’s fucking me. It made me cry & feel really hurt. I’m sure there were other instances of him doing this, but this one replays in my memory. To this day, I fear saying no & my body has the same response as if I owe it to them & im being selfish by saying no. It’s got me in horrible traumatic situations & im sad that i subconsciously repeat the pattern over & over again.

3528,Still in love with abuser,"It’s been about 2 months since I escaped through a window and ran to a neighbors house to use their phone and call the police as my phone had been taken. My ex and I were together for almost 3 years and roughly 2 of them he was physical. But that first year was like a dream. The old “too good to be true” saying really came into play here. When I tell you I’m not sure I’ve ever been so happy for so long I’m my life, I mean it. I was smiling and laughing constantly to the point my muscles were sore. Fast forward, things started to get ugly. I have been slapped, choked, kicked, punched, slammed into walls (leaving a head dent), marble counters, and tile flooring. Gun held to head being told he was going to kill me. I say this to show my level of insanity for still loving him. It wasn’t just a little slap on the wrist. 
I can get soooo mad. Blood boiling mad at him. But now, I can’t help but feel the loss. He moved his stuff out today and told me how sorry he was and he still loves me/wants to marry me. The me 3 years ago would look at this situation and not even believe the audacity of this guy to tell the girl he abused that he loved her. I still can’t understand why I feel love for him. So many hurtful things were said. So many painful actions were taken. So many financial wrongdoings and so on. 

I guess I just don’t know what to do with these feelings. I don’t wake up remembering a dream often but I’ve had a few within the past 2 months of me going back to him. Trying to sneak off with him without my parents and friends knowing. (I’m mid twenties, he’s early thirties. Not minors or anything.) And each time in the dream, something goes wrong. My parents spot us together on a security camera. He becomes abusive again. I’m isolated from everyone again. Unhappy etc. 
Its like my brain knows I can never go back or I’ll wind up dead But my heart still longs to be back with him.

Tonight I was nervous about the status of my relationship to my boyfriend because he has been saying recently that “things are going to change soon anyway” and that if I don’t start acting differently he’s going to “go away,” things of that nature. He said something like this under his breath tonight so I asked for clarification on the status of our relationship. He got annoyed with me for asking (whether we are monogamous &etc) and told me that if I don’t change and start “being loving,” he will not want to spend time with me anymore. In response to him giving me the above list, I said, “so you want me to be a stepford wife.” and hung up on him.

For context, I break up with him frequently but we have been together and usually break up for 2 days or less. I have attachment issues, my family abandoned me several years ago which he helped me through, and he knows this. I get extremely anxious and push/pull based on if I feel I am going to be abandoned. He dips into being avoidant and goes back to being loving and doting frequently.

We talked the other night and... he said he'd stop the name-calling and rude comments if I dedicated myself more to a consistent exercise routine, which I agreed to in the moment - so long as I made the terms. HOWEVER, last night I worked out for 50minutes instead of my standard 60minutes & when I came up from my workout, he bitched at me because he forgot what time I started at. ""WTF are you even doing?! You were down there for like 30 fucking minutes. You clearly fucking lied to me yesterday about trying. You can't even achieve a goal. Lazy.""

I’m 25F and he’s 26M and a lawyer. He’s honestly done nothing wrong, which is why it feels weird to even try to find a fault in that. He’s honestly perfect, but i just find that weird how he’s so perfect because I never met a guy who was. Only 2 weeks into dating and he wanted to be my boyfriend, he compliments me all the time, we opened up about our insecurities with dating, he always plans extravagant expensive dates. Right now we’ve know each other for 3 weeks and he said he’s buying us tickets to Hawaii because I mentioned I loved traveling (and that’s my dream date once when we played 20 questions.) it’s my dream date so I want to go, but he’s just all too perfect and nice to me that I worry it could be an abusive tactic. I even told him I was afraid he was love bombing and explained the word (he didn’t know) and he promised me he’s being himself and he thinks I think he’s perfect just because we’re so similar. He said he feels the same way that he thinks I’m so perfect too. My last ex was abusive so I kind of worry for my judgment. I love seeing him but idk what to do.

A year later he came back totally changed, sad and full of regret for what he had done to me, at first I didn’t trust him cause his change seem too good to be true, but now that we’ve been seeing each other for a couple of years I can see that he is genuine. He tries with all of his might to be better and wants to please me in every way. He tries to be good but from time to time the old him appears again, not in the same way tho, he doesn’t yell at the top of his lungs anymore or humiliates me in public like he used to do (he used to get mad at me for saying the wrong thing or wearing the wrong clothes, the more I tried to be the perfect girlfriend the more he would mistreat me), now he never raises his voice but has started to manhandle me and force me to do things that I don’t want to do when he gets frustrated(he only explodes when I reject him in any way, mainly physically or sexually). I feel bad for him tho cause I know that he’s a good person and I know that many times I have been anything but nice to him, he has put up with a lot of resentful mistreatments from my part as well, I’m no saint. He cries a lot and says he can’t be happy without me, he even talked about dying. I know that our relationship is over cause it’s impossible to forget the trauma that he caused me so I’ve decided to leave him for good and cut all contact with him, will I regret this? He has done things for me that make me think no one will ever love me like him. Has he changed?

\_I left our home 2 years ago, and have moved a few times during covid lockdown but he always found out where I lived somehow and tried to break in. I feel guilty for treating him bad, and I feel like I'm somehow sick in my brain for still loving and wanting his attention. I;ve moved to another country now, but he's still sending me emails and threatening to come to the country I'm at. There's a big part of me that just wants us to work. But I'm traumatised by all the physical and mental violence. Where can I get help, or how:? I'd love to hear suggestions. He's dangerous and I get it on one level but a big part of me still wants him to love me and be caring.

How and where can I get help to actually talk about what has happened without feeling ashamed and guilty. Would love some advice on moving forwards from years of mental and heavy physical abuse.

Sorry for rambling, I'm anxious atm and wondering if the best thing to do would be to just get back with him again... :( Any advice will be appreciated.

3600,Was in a bad marriage for 20 years-I got out and found the love of my life.,"20 years married to a narcissist and I finally got out.  Cheated on me.  Always accused me of cheating on him. Made me afraid to speak to any other man he didn’t know. Made me feel like I’d never make it on my own.  I couldn’t tell him how I felt about anything. It was always turned around and it would be my fault.  I was always saying I’m sorry. Even if I hadn’t done anything. If things weren’t done his way it was bad.  There’s so much more that I’m sure others have experienced as well. Too many to name. He Started drinking and taking pills. It got even worse.  He never hit me but I was afraid a few times he was going to shoot me with the gun he’d have in his hand.  Got out Christmas 2016.  He’s asked people to come to where I live and hurt me and destroy my things-said he’d pay them.  Told several people he’d kill me. 

Fast forward to 2018-met a great guy. Loving, makes me feel like I’m the only one. Been together for 1 year now.  It’s the kind of relationship that you dream about. You fantasize about.

Today: I was feeling very anxious about something he had casually mentioned to me. So I messaged him at work. Told him my concerns and guess what? He approached them with love and honesty.  Not screaming and placing the blame on me.  He talked with me about it and let me know it was ok to have these feelings and to talk to him about it.  

You see we’re a team.  We’re a partnership.  We’re in it for all the right reasons.  To know that he loves me the way he does is amazing.  To get to feel something I’ve never had before because I was never first in anyone’s eyes until now.  Always sends me messages to make sure my days going ok. He makes sure I know that I’m loved. We’re open and honest with each other. Sometimes I forget that it’s that easy if I have a problem to just go to him.  He’s my rock. We both have our issues/problems. But difference is that we share those with each other. We lean on each other. 

It’s out there you just have to be brave and take that first step.  It’s hard I know but I know you can do it.  You have to get away from the abuse. The negativity. The evil. Trust that it’s gonna be ok.  ",cannot be inferred,no,yes,no,cannot be inferred,,plausibly,yes,plausibly,yes,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred
3606,How do I trust again? & stop getting triggered? After being abused by someone I loved.,"So I’m new to reddit, but I really need someone to talk to. Over a year ago, the person I thought I was going to marry, have children with, etc. physically abused me. 

Lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m starting to become emotionally available again. Which is nice. But I don’t trust anything anyone says. I can’t help but read negatively into situations and assume the worst. It makes me push people away and not enjoy dating like I used to. 

Recently I started dating this guy and he was ignoring my texts and I finally asked him what he really wanted. Turns out he only really wanted to have sex when he had free time. We only hung out a handful of time but I felt myself becoming attached really quickly, which I know is not good. I feel very rejected. 

On top of that, I still get triggered by my ex. Whether it’s scenes in a movie or tv show where women get hit or seeing a man who looks like him on the street. Or riding in the passenger seat of a luxury car (where the abuse happened). I get triggered. Sometimes it just feels like a little nudge telling me to relive the end months of our relationship. Other times, i start hyperventilating, my heart beats really fast, my stomach basically falls out of my body. 

I got triggered yesterday by looking at his social media which I had strict rules for myself to not look at for this reason, but I slipped up. I know he is allowed to move on from what he did, but I hurts me to see people who know what he did still supporting him. 

I don’t know how to move forward. I feel very stuck and almost like I have some kind of ptsd from the whole ordeal. Im moving out from current living situation with roommates to place on my own and I’m very scared of being left alone because of the depression I feel creeping in.

3613,Why Am I Still Hopeful?,"Why do I still see the good in him? Why am I willing to love this man so unconditionally for the rest of my life? All while he has used me as a scapegoat for all of his problems. I know he hates me now. I know he thinks that I destroyed his life when the police got involved. You know what the crazy part was? He called the cops on himself. He was belligerently drunk. He is a raging alcoholic. His blackouts were an excuse to dismiss his actions. But me? I was crucified. I was persecuted for his mistakes. Yes, I have very much made my own, but I never went behind his back. I always kept our relationship private. But I had recently discovered, that he had no problem airing out my dirty laundry and making up lies to tell others; making him look like the victim. I was a slave to him. I served him. I did everything in my power to make myself ""better"" for him. 

""If I just do this, he won't get mad at me anymore. If I just do that, he will give me the love that I deserve""

It was never enough for him. I was never enough for him. I had nothing but love for this man and he abused it. Yet, I still yearn for his love. I still look at him as perfectly imperfect. But ""I ruined his life"". I ruined it by bringing reality right to his doorstep. Now, him and his family despise me. And lies have been told on my name. Somehow, I seek for their approval. For their love.

Part of me wishes that I lied on my statement to the police. Sometimes I wish I just protected him from the horrible consequences that he is about to face. Now, he is looking at potential felony charges. And I can only tell that his rage for me will grow. 

Why do I believe that he is the love of my life? When there's so many reasons not to. I lived for him, while he lived against me.",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,plausibly,yes,plausibly,plausibly,yes,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred
3614,"He was arrested today, I don’t feel okay","He called me from jail. My post history has more information on the charges, but essentially they are 2 felony assault charges. One for continuous violence (multiple times in a year) and one for strangulation. I picked up the second time because I know the lines are recorded. He sounded different than the last times we spoke. He said he has no intention of fighting this, and he will be in prison for a long time. He said he was sorry. He asked me to look into getting help for the cat that he brought to the relationship, but I grew to love so much and lived with. I had a friend go by his place to feed her and make sure she has water. 

I don’t know if I should take her. I would love to have her. But, if he is bonded out, then he will want to see her. 

I feel heart broken all over again. Punishment is not in my nature, but this was the only way forward to me. He wasn’t going to accept accountability. He sounded like he was truly accepting the gravity of what he had done on the phone. But I also know he is an excellent manipulator. I still want to see that kind, goofy, sweet man that I met. That I still saw sometimes. I guess that’s just my nature. I never wanted this. I’m devastated that he might spend his 30s in prison. I’m devastated I will have memories of feeling like I was going to die at the hands of someone I loved for the rest of my life.

3616,Is forgiveness out of the question?,"I had a long on and off relationship since I was very young. There is no one else I loved or could even imagine ever loving. For the most part it was solid. We had ups and downs, then we went our separate ways for about 5years. We reunited again and the love was even stronger than ever as we’re in our twenties. We moved forward with living together and talks of marriage. 

It all went downhill one night when he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs and beat me to almost death. I looked terrible afterward, I almost died or became paralyzed according to doctors. 
I luckily did not end up with any scars or problems. I healed well.


 He never hit me before and it’s like his personality changed that night. When he came to his senses he was distraught at what happened & did everything to help me!


I still love him and still think of everything we had. No one in my life thinks I should ever forgive what happened. No matter what! 
Was that the end? It may seem like a silly question but this was not an abusive relationship at all. It was once and thats why I don’t know if Im giving up too quickly.

3627,When do I stop feeling like I still love him?,"My ex and I were together for 9 years.  He was an addict and an alcoholic.  He abused me physically, emotionally, verbally, mentally, financially… we share two kids together.  I live with chronic pain from all the beatings, my credit is destroyed from always covering his missteps, I have an eviction on my record from living with him, I’m alienated from most of my family for staying with him for so long.  I work two jobs and I’m going back to school (student housing was the only way I could find a place affordable for me and the kids that wouldn’t care about my rental and credit history). He barely has one job and only works seasonally, so with winter coming he’ll be sitting around collecting unemployment while my workload will double.
I don’t know why, but despite everything, at the end of the night when I’m alone in my bed, all I can do is cry. I remember laying in bed with him and giggling and it felt like there was no one else but us. I remember when we met and it felt like love at first sight.  I remember when our babies were born and the way we smiled at each other afterwards.  I remember camping, movie dates, all the little fleeting moments full of joy and without drama or pain.  My heart hurts so much… why would I feel so much love for a person that hurt me so much, that knew how much they hurt me and couldn’t change…
I’m with someone new, and so is he.  I really like my boyfriend.  He’s mature, he communicates so well, he’s great with my kids, and he takes care of us. But he’s gone three weeks of the month working 900 miles away. We barely even talk most days because he’s so busy.  And even though his work ethic is just another thing I like about him, it’s not the same.   We have had amazing days together, he falls asleep holding me telling me he loves me, and all I can think is, this just isn’t the same….
My ex is with someone new too.  The kids say she’s nice.  She’s a homeowner, and he lives with her now. He’s sober. I have to drive by the house on my way to work every day.
When I think of him being his sober best self with someone else, I feel sick to my stomach. I feel like if we could change our names and run away, I’d do it.  I miss him so much.

3738,Processing. Blaming myself. Trying not to blame myself. Writing about it helps.,"I recently got out of a really messed up thing. It's so tempting to blame myself for not leaving sooner, but I'm trying to let go of that. I knew what was happening. I screen shotted texts messages he sent me that were basically straight out of a psychology textbook. I stayed too long.

Lyrics:

Verse 1  
Sometimes you can meet someone and you already know  
It's fine to trust with all your heart and there's no need to take it slow   
Chorus 1  
All day talkin’, sun above  
Bye bye caution, hello love  
Verse 2  
Giggling and laughing, running fingers through his hair  
Discovering the man who seemed an answer to your prayers  
Chorus 2  
All night walking, moon above  
Bye bye caution, hello love  
Verse 3:  
Everything was perfect till he got mad once and then  
You don’t deserve this, he would say before he did the same again  
Chorus 3:  
Verbal pushes, mental shoves  
Still you thought he deserved love  
Verse 4:  
Just because he’s flawed, you’d wonder, should he be alone?  
Compassion made you foolish, hiding what you should have known  
Verse 5:  
You heard so many fairy tales, it turns out after all  
The nightmare really starts when love is unconditional  
Chorus 3  
Bridge  
So remember this advice  
As long as you should live  
It isn’t dumb to trust  
But it’s stupid to forgive.   
​  
Verse 6  
He’s not your problem anymore so put him on the shelf  
Your only obligation now is to forgive yourself  
Chorus 4  
Verbal pushes, mental shoves  
You’re the one who deserves love

He was due back last Friday, but they extended his trip. He will be back for good this coming Friday and the guilt is eating me alive. So much so that I started packing my stuff up to go back before he got home. I don't want to go back, I know he doesn't love me, he is only nice to me when I stay quiet of his infidelity. I'm scared of what he will do and say when he realizes I'm gone. One of his side piece is delivering the news that we're gone when he gets back.. which probably wasn't my best idea. What helps you stay away? What keeps you out of their trap? He is going to lose his mind and try to talk circles around me. I intend on only contacting in regards to our daughter.

3747,My honeymoon phase love letter to you,"“you are offering me a home, a safe place, and for that I offer you my womb”. -9 months ago

I felt that. The idea of a home with you. Children, even. A family. In a safe place surrounded by leaves and flowers.

The reality of it, not so much. I’m a dreamy girl and you caught me dreaming of children laughing at your sillies. I never thought i’d ever dream of children, until you. I’ve woken up now, i guess.

“I don’t believe in honeymoon phases”, I said. “I’m a lover, E.”

But, I believe yours came to an end, not so long ago. So i guess what they say is true. It’s either that, or your love subsided. I feel it, you know? The absence of it.

I keep beating myself up trying to figure out what I did wrong. What i ‘do’ wrong. You’re sick of me. Whatever it is. Some things bother me and when they do,  I speak of them. I don’t think I should anymore, If we were to fix this. I make you so angry, and you vengefully make me so sad.

Why are you so angry? I ask myself. Maybe i make you feel worthless. Is it insecurity? From not being able to perform in bed? Sometimes i trick myself into hoping it’s because you’re afraid to lose me. I know it’s vain. But it’s either that, or you want to lose me.

“We need to find my triggers”, you explain. But, E, i think they are me.

And as i try to figure it all out, the reason for the nasties that come out, i stopped and started trying to figure out if i, me who loves you, me who thought that with a person like you i’d never leave,

should.

I left you, yesterday.

And i miss you, today.

Today marks my last day here. And I'm feeling worse than ever.
First I had to say goodbye to all my coworkers. On the way home I cried. When I arrived home, the nex was watching tv. I went to the bathroom, in the meanwhile he took the dog and drove away. I called my best friend who then talked me through on all of it. Why I made that decision. How I'm feeling. How the nex reacted to certain things throughout the last year. Why I'm struggling with my decision. 

After all, the nex is a human being as well. And I'm not comfortable just leaving him behind, in that house. Without his dog. All alone. No friends. No relatives. It's terrible and I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. But I need to by myself again, breathe, enjoy my life, be with my loved ones.

It's so goddamn hard.
I already packed some boxes. And it feels like each box gets heavier. I'm thinking about doing the last ones tomorrow. I'm tired. I'm devasted.

My partner is trans and having her bottom surgery in 10 days, we’re travelling all the way to Thailand for it. I’m absolutely terrified and I don’t think I can cope.

I’m autistic and I struggle with change, I can deal with small things day to day but this feels like too much.

I’ve never gone overseas before and it’s to a country with a completely different language and culture, on top of that she’s going to be having a huge change and I’m going to have to support her all by myself.

I struggled but supported her through her facial surgery 10 months ago and she got post op depression and it was really really hard and because I’ve got a degree of face blindness I struggled recognising her for a long time.

On top of that I’ve begun having seizures in the last two months and got diagnosed with epilepsy 2 weeks ago, I’ve also got ulcerative colitis and a heart condition and my colitis is currently flaring, I’m bleeding each day and I’m scared.

I don’t think I can handle being in Thailand, looking after her and potentially dealing with complications and her post op depression again.

I love her so much, I’d love her with or without surgery but I know she needs it to be happy but I’m just so so so scared, this is too much for me and I need someone to be there for me but she’s going to be out of action for potentially upwards of half a year if things don’t go well and I just don’t think I can do it.

I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to go to Thailand, I don’t want to do any of this, I wish I had time to rest and recover from my own illnesses but it’s too late and she needs this so much. 

I’m so scared and I don’t know how to cope does anyone have any advice :(

My partner is trans and having bottom surgery in 10 days, we’re travelling to Thailand. I’ve never travelled before, am autistic and struggling with change and have just been diagnosed with epilepsy and am having an ulcerative colitis flare up, I worry this is all too much for me, I want to be there for her but I’m terrified and I don’t know if I can do it while also being sick myself.",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
3760,Fiancé  has changed his mind about marrying me?  Not sure what to make of this.,"Currently in a situation I don’t know how to make sense of. For background, my fiancé and I have been together for a total of 4 years. In the end of 2021, my fiancé and I got engaged. From then, we decided that we would tie the knot this fall (‘24) once I was done with the military. Just a few months ago, he and I deviated from our original marriage plan and discussed eloping this spring/summer. From what I experienced, we were both excited and brought it up every week or so. 

Just three weeks ago, I went to my home state and visited family. He came out for a few days to visit, and suggested we should get married when we arrived back to our home. Fast forward to last night, and well… That is why I am here on Reddit now. I had brought up the elopement like we recently discussed and he became quiet. It took about 30 minutes to get it out of him, but we had a discussion and he ultimately let me know that he is not ready for marriage at this time. He said that it’s a huge commitment and he wants to be “100% ready for me physically, mentally, and emotionally”. He keeps letting me know that he still wants to marry me, but he needs to be “ready”. I’ve been pretty distraught since our conversation last night and feel like he’s playing me. 

However, it is important that I mention that my fiancé’s dad let him know just 2 weeks ago that he and his mom are planning for a divorce after nearly 30 years together. I know this has altered his perspective of marriage and I’m understanding of that. It just hurts to have someone I love switch up on me so fast. I’m not really sure what to make of this. I offered to move back home so he could have the space to decide what he wants. I feel very strongly about traditional marriage (grew up in an Italian household), and let him know I don’t want to maintain doing “wife things” for him if he’s this unsure. 

TDLR: Four years together, engaged for 2.5. My fiance suddenly let me know he isn’t ready for marriage, when just 3 short weeks ago he offered to elope this spring. He found out 2 weeks ago his mom and dad are divorcing after 29 years together. Not sure what to do as we live together.

3763,My husband says he does not have a gaming problem and only played for 50 hours in the past two weeks,"My (30F) husband (35M) of 7 years is an avid gamer. Just to caveat that so am I, and I have no issue with gaming in principle. Recently however I've felt that I'm bottom of my husband's priority list and all he does is play this game, which is online. Because it is online, he can't just stop instantly if I want to talk to him/tell him something, so I essentially have to 'wait my turn' every time I want to make conversation, which is making me feel neglected. If I mention it he'll tell me he'll happily spend time with me and just ask, but having to ask makes me feel like he'd rather do anything else and will hang out with me when called like some teenager being told to come downstairs for family game night. 

I game a lot myself, so I am not looking for him to be all over me every evening, but this morning I said I'm basically super low on his priority list and asked him to tell me how many hours he spends playing, to which he replied that in the last two weeks he's only played for 50 hours. Mind you this man has a full-time job and also likes to go out and play mobile games/other games, so 40h a week working, 25h a week on this game, 56h a week asleep... excluding other games and hobbies that don't involve me and I'm starting to feel like I'm just window dressing. He keeps telling me he does not have an issue because he can stop at any time. However for me the issue isn't that or even the time he plays, but how unavailable he is when he's playing. We can be in the same room without a single word to each other for hours, so I just end up with my headphones and music on because if I try and talk to him he doesn't respond half the time because he is busy. 

When he's not gaming he's very loving and huggy and listens to me talk, so he's not like this by default. He will also do stuff for me in between matches on the game, but that isn't the same as getting some conversation/attention, which he sees differently. 

*TL;DR* Husband plays online game which makes him unavailable for conversation and I feel neglected. He says there's no problem and will happily spend time with me if I just ask.

3766,“not just friends”,"I (35F) have been living with and spending every day with, showering with, being intimate with someone for a year , a bit more. We have been sharing a bedroom. He (33M) isn’t in a place where he wants to be committed but has agreed that we are more than just friends. 

A girl from his past (2013) came over with other old friends and we all hung out, before she came over he told me he was worried about being alone with her when hes drunk and requested that I don’t leave him alone with her. He has told me about her many many times, stating he is not interested though she has never stopped pursuing him on and off since 2013. 

I ended up finding them together in the morning. He claims he was asleep on the couch and woke up to her making out with him. They ended up in a different room and kept kissing. They couldnt have sex because he couldnt get it up (he says). He says he regrets it and blames the alcohol. 

Again we are not exclusive, but are exisiting as partners who have travelled the world together and spend every single day together. Like absolute best friends. And again, not “just friends.”

Dont know where to go from here. 

TLDR; Not just friends with the man I live with, he isn’t prepared to be committed because he needs to work on himself. Found him with a girl, alcohol blamed. Technically okay because we aren’t exclusive. I love him. Need advice.

3774,I’m (27f) scared my fiancé (28m) doesn’t love me,"We’ve been together almost 10 years. We have a toddler and a house and everything but marriage. We’re getting married this year but I’ve had a nagging feeling these past few months that he isn’t in love with me anymore. I’ve asked him once or twice before during an argument/fight and he convinced me he’s still in love with me. 

He used to be very clingy, wanting to be around me 24/7 and hugging and kissing and all. He makes my coffee most mornings, kisses me goodnight every night, makes my meals for me, brings me snacks and drinks. He takes care of me. 
I show my love by playing with him constantly, goofing off, hugging him whenever we get a break from our day, cuddling in his lap, touching him every time I walk by him, etc. 
Maybe our love languages are just different after all this time but he used to be the touchy one and now he doesn’t even remember to touch me. He never hugs me, rarely comes over to kiss me, and if he does, it’s because he’s interested in sex. 
We both work from home so are around each other 24/7 so maybe that’s a factor. 
Tonight, he got mad at me for something and just ignored it until I realized he was off, and when asked, he said everything was fine until I asked a few more times but still refused to talk about it. We didn’t talk or hangout for the rest of the night, even after the toddler went to bed. Now we’re in bed, and he’s just knocked out while I’m struggling to sleep, thinking through all of this. 
He used to refuse to go 10 min without talking over our spats in the past, let alone all night. I’d have trouble talking through fights because of how I grew up so It took a lot of fight from him to get me to talk, though spats, even whole days but I’ve been out of that for maybe two years or so now and can discuss our problems. Why has he refused to talk to me the past year or so about issues? 
I don’t know what’s going on. Am I overthinking things? Is he not in love with me anymore?

3776,Should I (24f) break up with my girlfriend (35f) to grow up?,"UPDATE: I just want to thank everyone for the responses. I think I needed the validation of what I realized was going on. I asked family for help and I'm getting out of the situation. I obviously have a lot to work on within myself so I'm  getting into therapy as soon as I have access to my money. 

A few months after my 6 year relationship ended (we started dating at 15) my current girlfriend and I started dating when I just turned 21. We moved very fast and moved in together after a week or two. We started working for the same company (owned by our best friend) about two months into the relationship. Right from the start she intimidated me a lot and made most of the decisions. I don't think she's aware that she does this, but I have brought it up. I'm not sure how I let this happen, but she also manages all the finances. All of our debt is on her name (since I don't have credit yet). She decides what we buy and when and how much we are allowed to spend. I have told her that this bothers me, especially since I have no control over my own salary. She always explains that she just does this because she stresses over finances and want to be sure she stays on top of it. I feel like this happened because I haven't had time to grow up and learn to be an adult yet, but every time I try to have a conversation about this it gets played down or just ignored. I'm starting to realize that I don't feel like this is a partnership but rather more like an adult and child dynamic. I don't know what to do. I can't figure out if I should let it go or would we have to break up. Other than the power dynamic and bad communication, we have very loving supportive relationship.

3778,so hard resisting going back,"feel terrible that ive become a frequent poster here but I really dont know what to do now

How do I resist going back to him.
After he physically attacked me for the 4th time (this time in front of his mother) and countless verbal abuse and belittlements I made up my mind to leave him 10 days ago.
sent back all his stuff and blocked him. I was so glad I did it for a couple of days but he used a new number to call me and then came by my place. This broke all the mental preparations that I've done in the past week.


He said he was sorry he made explanations, he made  promises he got a full time job, he became so ""normal"" sharing details of his life, he made plans to save money and travel together and he even becomes caring to my cats that he used to hate. this is the nicest he has ever acted to me.
this is just a mask? a tactic to soften me up right? just because he saw I was planning to leave FOR REAL this time, right?

I knew it is going to be bad going back to him. he scares me, it has been a suffocating experience walking on eggshells but all the things he said gave me so much false hope. I am devastated.



Do I need to list out all the terrible things he has done to me as a reminder??

im thinking about sending him a  final text then getting a new phone number.
I am scared to talk about this with my friends again because I have told my friend I would leave him so many times and they can't understand why I stayed. For a whole day I really considered the possibility staying and I feel stupid af.

We sleep in separate rooms and our son sleeps in my room. I asked him over and over to leave so he wouldn't wake up our son. He stomped around, slammed doors, and then came in my room and sat on the floor. He demanded I go out in the hall to talk. He also said he would prevent me from going to work today if I didn't. I eventually caved. He yelled at me for over an hour.

I told him I wanted to leave him and he sneered and said I can't. I eventually caved again and we made up. I went to bed dead set on leaving his abusive ass.

But now today he acted all sweet, like nothing happened. Like he hadn't spent hours in the middle of the night terrorizing me. So I'm struggling to stay angry at him.

It also got me thinking: was he really abusive or was it me who caused him to react & treat me the way he did? I often think of this. When I left, he wanted to commit suicide because I wasn't coming back. But then he met his now wife & all of a sudden was 'in a better headspace than he's ever been in'. 

He treats her so well. He married her instantly, they have a nice trailer they live in. They're having a baby (he maliciously told me after we split that he was going to marry me if I waited after I left & he realized he wanted kids just not with me which is untrue he always wanted to have kids but after one pregnancy scare I went on birth control). 

I often think of what was so wrong about me that he couldn't treat me right for 6 & a half years but this total stranger he met on bumble was worthy of a nice man within one month.

She said something along the lines of, ""it's not like he beat me around the clock everyday. There were many moments he was very sweet and thoughtful."" And that's really how it is. 

This is the part I fall in love with and come back to so many times, a part that is almost boyish of before he was hurt with the trauma he endured. 

A few nights ago he was furious with me and went to sleep just angry at having to deal with my incompetence, but just as we fell asleep a huge storm had startled both of us awake  Just then is when the little boy side came out wanting love and security by grasping me instinctively tight. 

Every time it's that or some awful dream I cherish it. I melt into it a little harder it feels like and in those moments of my comfort it's like we are both so vulnerable and the intimacy builds. It just feels purer in those moments.

 Moments where he whispers so softly the sweetest things in my ears. ""What's wrong?"" when I'm tossing about too much..""Come here baby."" when I'm not close enough. ""My beautiful girl"" as I'm half asleep dreaming and he rubs my back in awe of me next to him.

3805,Hard recovery of an emotionally abusive partner: how to not go back? How to move on?,"It’s been 8 months since i left what i felt was an emotionally abusive relationship of more than 12 years. I was basically all my life with him. My first in everything. 

Last years with him were really difficult. A situation where my mother died made me not to continue closing my eyes to a situation i was not ok with for a long time. He was not emotionally there to me when this (or when my grandpa died) happened. I needed him so much that the things i usually told me to forgive him everything didn’t work anymore.  

At the same time i was reading and listening a lot about emotional abuse and narcisistic behaviour. A lot of the things i had lived all these years suddenly had an explanation. And nothing i could do would change the way he treated and was treating me. The resentment was unbearable. I rationalized the relationship and understood that i had a choice for my next 10 years not to repeat all the fighting, gaslighting, neglect, anxiety…

Of course i still loved him when i left him, but i was in such a bad mental place that there was nothing i could do but leave. I was starting to be someone i was not. We have been no contact.

The first 6 months after the break up had been freeing in a lot of aspects. I even started to see another guy that treats me SO well i cannot believe things being so easy were posible. I cannot believe he does not think i am a problem. I cannot believe i do not feel anxious or disrespected. 

But i still think of my ex in daily basis. I still ruminate. I still feel like doing something wrong for seeing this guy. I still think i am the blame for breaking a stable relationship when we were about to move forward in life (buying a house, thinking on children…). My friends are moving on in life and i just went back 12 years. 

It’s been 8 months and i still feel angry (even more than before bc i understand better with the distance). I am with this new guy,who is really doing efforts, who took me out to dinner in valentine days (never did this with my ex anymore) thinking: was it so difficult? Why couldn’t you (my ex) be this way? 

I feel bad seeing this new guy while i don’t feel completly over my ex. He is everything my ex wasn’t, but i do not feel right with him either. I am loving him but i am not in love with him. He doesn’t deserve it and i feel scared of this new relationship i am creating eventhought it fells secure.

3812,It's hard,"Been a few months since I left you. I had the courage to break it off. It was tough and still is. I feel like there's still too many steps I have to take. Each and every step is getting harder and harder. Too late for me to turn back and it's too early for me to let go. I'm still in this rut.
I know I can claim my belongings, I just need the strength. I find it hard to picture all of my things gone. Gone from the home that we shared. So many memories. It was a tough ride but we made it, just for me to let it go. I never thought I'd see the day that I just let it all fall. Right in front of me.
I texted you last night to pack my things, so my dad can pick them up. It did not sink in last night but I'm a mess now. Realising how empty and lost I feel. This heartache is real, it pains me.

Had everyone fooled. Fooled them into thinking we had it all. A hard working couple with goals. Most importantly I fooled myself. I'm so embarrassed. 
I resent you but I still miss you. I miss your voice when you were calm. I miss your hands when you were gentle. I miss your smile when you were happy. I miss your love whether it was real at one stage or not.

3813,"It wasn’t hard for him for to hit me, why is it hard for me?","Hello everyone, A week from today I left my  three and a half year abusive relationship. It was always an agonizing cycle,  he would get upset, escalated to furious, abuse me,  then call mommy and daddy (our landlord) to come run me out of our home. I have witnessed this boy not only abuse me, but verbally abuse his parents, as well as abuse multiple drugs as well as alcohol. It was getting to the point his parents were also getting comfortable getting in my face. This boy has been treated for his mental illness before, but hasn’t continued going (he even told his therapist he was abusive, when he last went two years ago.) The night I left,  my entire family, as well as local police, were there to get me.  That night (11:00 p.m) I just wanted to get out of this toxic household, and as he had fled the scene anyway, I did not press charges. My hair is falling out, knots were felt in my head, and he has continued to try to contact me to try to bring me back. So, in my state, in order to file a restraining order, I must pressure charges. I have two years worth of evidence of things he has done to me, and I went in two days after I left to press charges. It makes me absolutely sick to my stomach to face this boy in a court room. The last time I saw him, everything was fine until he blew up again. The could still book him, as well. Is it bad I want none of this to happen? It’s not out of love, but every time I try to think of what’s to come, it puts me on the verge of vomiting.

I didn't contact him. The first time he contacted me saying he had nowhere to go and no money leading me to say I'd ""think about it"", I contacted a domestic violence agency for advice. I decided to email him my response that I wasn't changing my mind but he could store his stuff in my garage until the end of the year, and I would keep ""our"" dog. (He has one; I have one; we acquired one). He called and texted harassing me, so I filed an Order of Protection, the last thing I really wanted to do, but my child heard part of what he said.

I also do not need advice since I have taken steps to leave (steps which do not exactly feel empowering for reasons mentioned below).***

I called the police and opted to get the emergency order of protection, and I hate that he pushed me to do those things. I did not want to get the legal system involved. I do not believe its most powerful actors care about me, and these actions ultimately have not made me feel safe or reassured. Even having the police in my space to take a report was triggering, and the judge that heard my case was cold and intimidating. To make matters worse, he does have a criminal record (a DUI and drug possession, I believe, both from when he was in his 20s). I thought about that as I elected to not press charges. Still, I decided to request the order for two reasons. 1) I think he will continue to contact me unless there is the threat of legal consequences, unfortunately. 2) I actually am tempted to reach out to him and hear him out. I know this will not be helpful to me in the long run, so the order actually holds me accountable to not going back. 

Knowing about his record is partially why I wanted to keep this in civil court. I also think it is highly possible that after these 21 days are up, I will stay gone but just vacate the order. I have no faith that a judge won’t just see this as “Black people getting violent and fighting the way they always do” or be unsympathetic to me because Black women are often seen as stronger, violent, more tolerable/deserving of abuse, etc.

3854,Literally left him today. Why is this so hard 😐,"I was explaining to my friends about my ex fiancee. Ex Fiance was manipulating and saying that everything is my fault. I pointed out his past behaviors (punched a wall and made a hole, punched the fridge which left him with bloody fingers, pushing me,driving recklessly,  screamed/yelled and cursed at me at the top of his lungs). Fiance noted that I deserved all of the above and that I need to focus on myself to make me happy and then he can be happy ( yeah like wtf). I noted that he's terrifying when he's angry and he apologized and said that he will ""work on it"" he refuses to go to one on one therapy/couples therapy as he feels that he did nothing wrong. He then stated that we're not a ""real couple"" because we have not have sex and demanded a couple months prior that we need to have sex to be a real couple (ya can't force someone to do it). My friends were livid and so we drove over and had two police officers escourt me to his apt and I grabbed all my stuff. I feel like I'm going through a rollercoaster of emotions.

He has not shed one tear since the break up despite telling me and his family I was his soul mate. He says he will live his life in regret, but has not seemed regretful. And today, told me I would do anything for him, but he would do nothing for me. 

I sat there and was gaslit for hours (A small example: ""I feel something and you tell me I am wrong"".

3858,Please someone tell me it's the right decision to let it all go. Having a hard time.,"We were in a relationship for about 7 years. Since college. He cheated twice and there was physical abuse involved. I gave him another chance and he said that it would not happen again. 

He improved a lot after that. We were fighting a lot. During COVID I got close to another guy online. We never met in person. He found out about that. And physically abused me for 3 days because I was not accepting my mistake. I do feel it was my mistake and I was really sorry for it. I never thought I would cheat but I did

Later after some days I found out that he was talking to this chick online and they were sending each other nudes. When I confronted him he physically abused me for that too and later saying that he only did it because we were not talking and there was no intimacy between us. 

I still love him. We broke up around 9 months back. We both wanted be together but he started seeing someone right after we broke up.

Can anyone please tell me if it's right to working on things in this relationship and can I come out of this and feel things for him again sexually. He said he would only stay if I start feeling for him again and maybe not now but in some years is also fine. 

After a few months of our breakup he apologized and said sex is not the only thing thats important for him but he would only come back if things work between us but he won't leave this other chick who he is in a LDR with as thier respective parents had gotten involved, till it's decided we can work on things. He told me that he doesn't love her.

I want to work on things and I miss him a lot even now. He always wanted to work on things but I was the one who lost hope after the physical abuse. He even tried to apologise but I was just not ready to listen. I feel now that I made a mistake by not giving it another try.

There has been no abuse what so ever in this relationship. He does have ""cute aggression"" and constantly wants to squeeze me and tells me he wants to kill me because of how adorable i am. Is this okay? I don't know how to take it. A year into dating i thought it would go away but it didn't.

3872,Feeling it hard after leaving,"TLDR: Miss my ex after breaking up with him, struggling with panic attacks, loneliness, any advice?


Umm so I left my bf and we are in limited contact. After the break up there were a few issues with the way he acted/things he said, but we were able to be civil after he sobered up, bc he gave me apologies that my therapist had said before are real and meaningful, with measured steps (something he has never done with me). I miss him more than I thought was possible. My body aches, my mind only thinks of him. I just cry all the time or watch tv to pass the time, but I cant even organize my stuff after moving it from our once shared place. It feels like we're breaking up all over. It hasnt been long but I just want to speed through it all. I'm numb except when I'm triggered or miss him then I'm crying/anxiety/panic attacks alone and in public etc. I'm also dealing with severe  depersonalization which is really really hard for me.


I've been talking with friends weekly and seeing a therapist weekly and it just feels like my ""cup"" has a whole it in at the bottom. When I'm alone, I spiral and  fight with myself about my decision. My friends and family are supportive of me and are so happy that I left....but I just want to go back sometimes bc I miss him and other times I cry bc no one where I'm at will hurt me when they get drunk and I haven't had that in so long.

It doesn't help my clarity that he is literally being the best man, actually doing the difficult things that he said he was going to do, aggressively trying to prove that he can be the best man for me. 

I don't feel like myself, hell I don't even know who i am anymore. I'm just getting deeper and deeper into numbness. My therapist suggested we keep our sessions at once a week, instead of twice like I feel like I need right now.

He would have rage attacks, psychiatrist thinks its either borderline or narcissistic personality disorder or both. we broke up but I have a hard time accepting that he was abusive.

I was afraid he would leave and not come back, because he left twice for a week and ignored me and I felt very anxious.… I ams 163cm he is 180cm so its not like I am stronger .. but now I feel like I caused these situations and also miss my ex…is this real, trauma bond, denial, dissociation, depression or what??

I wouldn’t say our relationship was perfect, there was definitely some narcissistic behavior on his end but I was in love with him. We went to a baseball game and he got stupidly intoxicated. He ran off into this park area outside of the baseball stadium so I chased after him. We argued some more and then I walked away from him because I was trying to get him to the car and he came up behind me, shoved me hard causing me to fall onto the ground. He then got on top of me and we preceded to fight until I managed to get him off of me. After I got up I began to run from him and we both fell off a 40 ft drop off. Long story short we both ended up in the hospital. 
I moved out, got a restraining order and a military protection order but we still work together at the same command and live in the same area. For the last couple of months I continuously see him. I don’t sleep much anymore, I barely leave my apartment unless it’s to go to work, I have panic attacks and I think I’m depressed. 
Anyways - Today I finally spoke up to an advocate and told her what has been going on with me. Because my ex and I still work at the same command and I see him almost on a daily basis, I told her I feel like I’m going crazy. I am in counseling but every time I feel like I’m moving forward, I run into him and I’m back at square one. I have been given the choice to transfer commands, completely leave the state if I want too. But I’m torn. I love my current job, my co workers and my new apartment.

We went to dinner. A restaurant I had been to only once but adored. I was excited. He was wrapped in 'business stuff' (full disclosure: he's able to do such bc I found some money over the last year and essentially invested in him, for us... I haven't much left to me now)
Seems to have gone to his head... anyway, our daughter was being a typical 3.5 year old (she's usually pretty well behaved in restaurants but at this stage, every day is a new adventure). He was not present with us. She knocked his phone off the table (he has two), happened faster than I could catch. He slapped her hand pretty hard... I was shocked though we were the only ppl at the resto still. I didn't dare say anything and daughter handled it fine.
A father and two young boys (not local, we live abroad and are conspicuous that way) walk in and sit down behind us. Spouse continues to be distant, distracted and moody (fine, whatever). I dare at some point to take a second look at the menu and in such time, dd carelessly knocks over my relatively full glass of wine. We aren't rich so this is an expensive loss. I know I showed shock
k snd disappointment... but I seriously doubt I was an 'embarrassment' like he likes to say I am when convenient.
I didn't slap my daughter. I just said something like 'f**k' and not 'loud' either. 
He started telling me (again) how I'm an embarrassment and not worth it, that he absolutely hates being around me. 'Figure it out'

I had tears, he demonized that too.
I was ruining his reputation

He was perfectly happy to have me serve him all day and the years prior.

I pay the bill (he doesn't have the money)... it's one wine glass too expensive bc of our kid (I don't hold that accident against her, though she was told yo mind the table in no uncertain terms)

In the car he's making conversation like it's any ordinary day (despite any action to merit it he blocked me on WhatsApp back in the restaurant, just bc he saw I wasn't going to hide my hurt).

I also don’t want to feel angry at him because we are trying to rebuild. Tomorrow was supposed to be our seven year anniversary.

3934,I’ve been lying all day and I have to tell someone.,"All day I’ve been lamenting with family that my husband couldn’t make it to Christmas because he’s sick. All day I’ve felt ill about the lie.

He wasn’t there because on Christmas Eve I called the cops on him. It started as an argument of him being too drunk to get up for Christmas last year (he drinks from the moment he wakes up and heavily on the evening), which turned into him screaming at me, threatening to kick down the bedroom door, take my phone, and disable my car. I tried to leave, but as I was trying to bring things to my car (before waking up the kids) he physically blocked me inside.

I told him repeatedly to let me go or I would call the cops, and he told me to do it while continuing to block me in.

He was then shocked and appalled when I called the cops. His dad ended up picking him up and bringing him to their house, but he walked home. Barged in at 4am giving me a heart attack but at least he slept on the couch.

Today he is drunk again and asked twice where his Christmas present is. Then he demanded to know why I called the cops. I sent him videos of him shouting and blocking me. He responded with “I deserve an answer for why you called the cops” and “I have never been physically violent.”

Now I am sleeping on the couch and terrified of him starting things up again. I would stay somewhere else but logistically it’s so hard with 2 little kids (not to mention 2 pets).

3938,Family is making the DV situation so much harder,"Backstory - i left my domestically violent relationship and moved in to my sister’s apartment a few months back. It’s a small place, i came with multiple pets, and it’s been a hard transition. 

We haven’t lived together as adults - ever - and there is a huge age difference between us of 14 years. 

During my relationship I was out of state and away from my family for all of it. I didn’t have the most emotionally available parents and I basically decided I needed to be my own independent person at 18 because of it. I saw my family once a year and i feel like I’m basically a stranger. I knew this coming back.

Coming back meant me giving some intel to my family on why. It’s such a hard relationship / conversation to navigate with others. No one wants to ask me questions and I don’t want to traumatize other people by over sharing. Pair that with the shame and guilt and unhappiness i feel with my life falling apart and i feel so lonely. I don’t have any friends in the area my family lived but i just thought it made sense to move here. I also felt like i couldn’t “burden” my friends with me as i feel like they r all uncomfortably trying to support me but have no idea what to do either. 

I just overheard my sister complaining about me on the phone and she said ive been rude lately to her and she’s stressed. The most hurtful thing was next - her saying she suspects my “situation” (i.e. my husband being violent towards me) is due to how i treated him. Like she’s drawing parallels to how im treating her and it’s warranted. 

I’m working really hard on how to process that type of statement and I just am so hurt. I also feel like she’s actually been insanely mean to me in the past few weeks and she’s openly said she’s really stressed at work. Clearly our communication and living together is a work in progress - it’s brand new i feel that 100% too - but dang to then attribute that to why my husband did what he did? I feel like running away but i have no idea where to run to now.  Feeling lonely today. Feeling no direction. Feeling like My life is a giant floating ball of no purpose.

3945,"“Just go buy new clothes, go to the gym, eat vegetables and everything will be better”","Sorry for the rant but I was wondering what you guys think about this.

So basically, I have lots of unhealed trauma, starting from early childhood and the past three years with my abusive ex boyfriend destroyed me in more ways that I could imagine. 

He depleted my bank account, abused me sexually and destroyed my mental health.

What I see on here a lot is this type of advice that some people give: “just get a glow up, girl, you’ll look better and feel better”, “invest more in skincare and new clothes”, “go on dates”, Etc. 

I know that they only mean well with this type of advice. It’s meant to motivate, to feel better about oneself and so on. 

I am not saying that these things do not help with improving ones self esteem. But they are the wrong type of advice! As if I or many others HAD something to improve. As if our emotional turmoil resulting from abuse would be solved by spending 200$ at Sephora. Or signing up for dumb Yoga classes.

I was buying nice clothes and hitting the gym three times a week before I met him and also during the relationship. It didn’t change anything.

I think it’s somehow shallow to tell this people who recover from those type of relationships or any trauma because it gives them the impression that improving ones looks will improve ones self confidence.

Back then, after my abuser started escalating the abuse, I fell for this type of advice and it made me think that it had something to do with me.

3946,I want my clothes back...,"Basically to give backstory...

My (19F) ex (19M) went through my cupboard when we were dating, pulling out my hoodies and t-shirts (particularly my favourites, including a t-shirt that my best friend had given me) and taking them with him. Every now and then, he'd drop old running tops and a pair of his old pyjama shorts on me without asking me, refusing to take them back. He'd wear the clothes (we're mostly the same size, although of course being male his shoulders are a bit wider and his arms a little more filled out) and sleep with them, claiming that although he couldn't smell, they ""felt"" like me. When I'd ask for my clothes back, he'd refuse, try and distract me from getting them, wrestled them off me, hid them, you name it, he would do it to keep them from me.

When we broke up, he told me he'd put my clothes in a bag and stowed it in his cupboard. We haven't spoken since around October, and he's been passive aggressively displaying a lack of civility in terms of social media and when we'd have to encounter one another (unfriended/unfollowed me on everything, which I don't mind, because I did the same. The issue is more so I don't feel as though I can talk to him about getting my stuff back because it feels like he's put up an inpenetrable fortress around himself, something he does whenever he takes issue or offence at someone or something) and he basically made it clear I wasn't welcome at the Rover Crew I was trialling, which I had introduced him to a few months before and he had done everything to make it clear it was only for him.

I texted him yesterday morning to ask for my clothes back, no response, I doubt he's even read the message. In case you were wondering, he didn't take more than a couple of hoodies and at least one tshirt (unless he took more without me noticing or remembering).",irrelevant,no,plausibly,no,no,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,no,no
3947,I've lost everything to my name but the clothes on my back because I trusted the wrong person. Has anyone rebuilt their life after feeling like they will never recover from a toxic relationship?,"I've gotten myself into a very desperate situation with someone. The relationship has spanned about 5 years and always had a lot of drama and ups and downs and I keep going back after swearing I will never talk to this person again. But this time, I quit my job, put my house up for sale and moved cities to be with this person based on a lot of what are now obviously empty promises. He told me he would take care of me and that he was making changes in his life for the better like slowing down on drinking, smoking and just taking better care of himself. And I believed him. 

Once I moved in with him, there were a series of extreme highs and extreme lows and all the work he was putting in on himself stopped. In hindsight the highs and lows have always been a problem but it became pronounced once I was spending every day with him. I would hear him talking to friends and family on the phone and he idealized me one day and I was the absolute devil the next. One day I was amazing and the best thing to ever happen to him, the next day I was using him, lazy and a slob (even though I was unpacking, looking for work and doing the daily chores every day while he went to another room, avoided me and did nothing all day but talk on the phone and scroll through the internet). 

He also asked me to marry him once I moved in and now a month later, I'm finding myself kicked out with no job and no finances in the midst of a pandemic. This happened over a small argument and the response just did not match the situation. I honestly feel like I'm a crazy person at this point because I can't piece together why this all happened and why the response to a small argument was so extreme. I feel so stupid, helpless and ashamed. 

At this point I'm living with my Mom and my young daughter and we only have the clothes on our back. He will not let me gather any of my personal belongings. I'm basically at rock bottom, I've lost everything and I'm just looking for advice from anyone that's been in a toxic relationship on how you moved on and rebuilt your life after being in a situation that you feel like you'll never recover from.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,plausibly,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
3948,Finding my sense of style and clothing choices after abuse.,"I (24F) bought a car back in 2016 with hard earned cash from work. Got it from a family member and it ran pretty good for something made in the mid 2000s. I 20 at the time. Sister was 18 leaving for college and I was in basic/finishing basic training. 

My sister decided because she was going to college and I bought a car, I had too many material things and cleared out my drawers and closet's ( I had 2) and took all of my clothes to college with her. I was left with the clothes in my bag in my locker at basic. 

Eventually, she thew these things away when she got new things. One year later we were both home to visit and I stole 2 of her T-shirts (not okay I know) but I felt justified I was still building my wardrobe back. She saw it in my packing bag and dumped everything out cursing at me and it broke my iPad. My mother and her were screaming at me for stealing and calling me a thief. I have apologized cried and gave the shirts back. 

One year ago I finally had my wardrobe built back up. But I was dating an abusive partner who I had to escape from. I ended up leaving crates of belongings with him so now I don't have much. How can I make sure these sort of things don't happen again? And why do I still feel guilty for stealing two shirts years ago if we have moved on?

3954,i don’t know if i’m being abused,"I(22f), and my (25m) boyfriend have been dating on and off since i was 16. he’s always had anger problems in our relationship and i’ve broken up with him for an extended period of time because of it. he will hit himself, scream, hit things, and say very mean things to me in arguments. i used to be someone who could yell back i grew up in a very loud household. but i think since turning 18 i’ve become a lot more patient and mellow. 
On valentine’s day i slept at his house. i put my bag with my makeup in it on a ledge so i could put my clothes away for tomorrow. i also folded my clothes and put it next to my bag for the next day. he woke me up at 1 am when i get up at 5 to yell at me because i meses up his bathroom. i honestly tried to be as neat as i could, i didn’t think it was messy i tried to take up as little space as i could too. he ended up blocking me into the bathroom while he screamed and threw my book bag across the room. he kept telling me to leave but everytime i tried he would block me in. in the morning while we were driving he asked me if i had anything to say to him. i said no? he started yelling and hitting his steering wheel while driving because i wouldn’t apologize. he told me to get out, so i did, and that set him off even more. i walked home from where we were and it was about 45 minutes. now where i try to talk to him about that he says i need to change how i act as well not just him. i don’t think i am mean in fights. i try to talk things out but when someone is yelling at me i get annoyed and i will get a bit upset and swear. i don’t know i just don’t know what to make of this. i’m sad, i love him but i don’t feel like he loves me.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,yes,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,yes
3957,"Have you ever wondered if you're just completely incompatible with your partner and you bring out the worst in each other, or if they are just abusive?","For some time I kind of felt reluctant to accept the labels of victim and abuser. Yes, he was very controlling and paranoid about me. He would restrict me from going to certain places because it would trigger his insecurities (the gym), he would micromanage my social media, make me erase old pictures, micromanage my clothes, and so on. He would also mistrust me continuously and think I'm cheating on him if, for example, I forgot to update him with pictures throughout the day or if the call dropped. 

But then sometimes I start thinking... Well, what if he found a girl who doesn't care at all about these things? Let's say, a girl who doesn't care about the gym, doesn't care about the clothes she wears or doesn't care about the fact he's putting restrictions on her based on his fears. Because theoretically if she doesn't mind, or if she's naturally a person who doesn't really care about her own appearance, she may feel fine in the relationship. I think there are women out there who are fine with their man putting restrictions on them and don't consider that abusive. Or maybe there's something in me that triggered him to act this way (I never cheated on him though, I was loyal). 

Have you ever wondered that? I know I can't take my ex's words as truth. But he said that with his new girlfriend, the one he quickly found after our relationship ended, he didn't have the same control issues and so on. Of course, I don't know the truth of this, but have you ever wondered this? Have you ever wondered if you bring out the worst in each other? 

I have a clear example of this. My father was abusive to my mother. I've seen it with my eyes. He would come home drunk, my mom would start fighting and it would end in physical violence (my father towards my mother). It was really really chaotic. He found a new wife after they divorced. Their dynamic is a little bit different: she's very domineering and for whatever reason he's much more submissive with her. However, there are still some issues that are problematic. Yes, he has hit her, but it has happened once or twice, opposed to how constantly it was with my mother. I can't say he's a better man, but he's been repressing himself much more. 

So what do you think? How do you know if it's basic incompatibility issue, or plain abusiveness?",cannot be inferred,no,yes,no,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
3958,Gradually more critical of how I dress - indirectly controlling behavior,"Has anyone else experienced a partner who gradually became more critical of how you dressed? My ex was critical of a lot of things but this was just bizarre to me. Unpacking some feelings tonight (yay) and realizing that at the beginning of my relationship, he would like my outfits and how I dressed. Keep in mind, my clothing style hardly changed over the past 4 years. As time went on, he started expressing how he wished I wore shorter and more tight-fitting clothes, especially around the house..all under the guise of ""you're hiding yourself"". I started buying and wearing clothes that fit that description around him for some kind of validation and to prove I wasn't hiding myself. I deliberately chose my clothing style before meeting him and never had anyone make the comments he did. Anyway, even after going out of my comfort zone wearing short shorts around the house, he would say I never wear revealing clothes that flatter my figure. One time he even denied intimacy because I was wearing silk pj's (I thought they were cute??) and they apparently turned him off. That really threw me for a loop because I wouldn't care what my partner was wearing if I was attracted to them. I was hurt from feeling rejected but was basically forced to understand his perspective. That conversation actually led to us breaking up the same day. But the cycle continued.

Since then he got more comfortable commenting on what I was wearing: ""you're wearing that?"" just as we had to leave the house, ""why can't you wear stuff like that?"" while watching a music video (you know which ones), or ""I cannot take you seriously in those sunglasses can you take them off?"" until I took them off. What's weird is he would 100% judge a girl for wearing skimpy clothing even if he liked it. The irony. I never knew what to make of his comments until I recently realized it was kind of a form of control over me.

Well today, I took those sunglasses out of the bag I had buried them in weeks ago and wore them proudly.

I like it when you show me your cleavage. You have curves. Why do you hide them? You should dress like that more often. I don't like pink. You look good in red. I like green he says, it would look good on you especially with your hair. Its wow!(I HATE green--I bought a couple of green things...and can't wear them)

The reason I ask, is because this has just crept up on me. I started buying clothes to show cleavage. I started buying clothes to show off for him. The kind that he liked. He would tell me....I like it when you dress like that. You should dress like that more often.

No one has ever been this nice to me. So its really nice to hear. But I am literally buying things I wouldn't normally buy because of him. He gives me more attention when I do.

3961,What was/is the worst part about being in an abusive relationship that isn’t always talked about?,"I’ll go first:
I often feel like my life is on literal pause. I’m so unsure of the status of my relationship most of the time. I am always anticipating the next major blowup and trying to prepare and prevent it that it quite literally consumes all of my thoughts and has a direct influence on all decisions and actions. It’s not uncommon that I feel like my reality is a huge blur just in general. The only thing I am certain of 100% of the time is that I want out and need to figure a way out asap. So with that being said, I think my brain is registering my life as being in stand-by mode (for lack of a better explanation). I live day by day and am always prepared to have to up and leave within moments notice. I’ve gotten my belongings down to essentials only and any important documents or anything of sentimental value that I wish to preserve has been strategically taken to my mothers for safe keeping. Mine and my daughters personal belongings are packed into storage bins with only things we need to use daily being out. I don’t even hang our clothes or put them in drawers anymore. Our clothing is neatly folded into storage cubes under the bed. I’ve managed to fit all of our stuff into 5 small storage bins that can easily and quickly be loaded into my SUV at any time. It’s kinda crazy to think that at 34yrs old this is everything I own. This has become my life….I operate in survival mode and patiently wait for my opportunity that I’m not even sure will ever come. Until I get out, there’s nothing else. There’s no plans for the future, no other goals beyond this, and nothing to look forward to until we’re finally free. I can’t wait to regain control over my life again and to feel like I have power over the direction it goes in. 

So yeah….feeling like life is on pause while the entire world around you keeps going on. In my opinion, definitely one of or maybe THE worst part of this experience. 
I assume it’s probably similar to the feeling prisoners experience while being locked up. 

Sorry for the long post. I tend to get carried away with my rambling on here cuz it’s become my only “safe place” for me to share what I’m going through and to vent. Anyways, YOUR TURN.

I watch him. He bends over, takes one out at a time, and puts it away. I literally stopped doing laundry while he was home because it stressed me out so much. I used to be able to put the laundry on the bed, I don't know why all of a sudden, I'm not allowed to. Again, he changed the rules without telling me.

OCD for cleanliness? Thats what I thought. But he lets the bathroom get really messy. Leaves crumbs on the kitchen counter. Doesn't care about the kitchen floor. Its very odd. He had to keep the bedroom, spotless. He'd spend 3 to 4 hours cleaning the bedroom top to bottom baseboards and all. Pledge, vacuuming the corners, under the bed and dressers.

I don't set his work clothes out for him he yells at me. 
His moods are unpredictable and psycho... He snaps at the drop of a pin.

He comes in and tells me not to leave to put my stuff away, that I ruined his day and his weekend...

I open another bag and start bagging my things back up again, he grabs that bag and rips it open and repeats trying to put my clothes away.  He kept telling me that we need each other that I can't leave and we need to stop doing this to each other and all the while I'm cowering in the corner having an anxiety/panic attack. He won't let me leave, took my phone and hid it. Won't let me talk to anyone, I'm using my laptop with the neighbors spotty internet connection allowing me to do this.

Whenever I complained about the excessive amount of control and paranoid jealousy he was feeling, he would say that's normal and any man who loves feels this. 

I mean, I can understand a certain level of jealousy or fear to lose your partner, but I think it has to be founded or have some basis. He would become paranoid over things such as the call dropping or me receiving the text message and would continuously inquire who texted me or who called me. He would need continuous pictures throughout the day to reassure him and put his mind at peace. Me interacting with any man would be a complete NO, no matter if it was a coworker or what. He controlled my social media, micromanaged my clothes and I literally lost my voice in the relationship. It was his way or the highway. 

I was also somewhat to blame for accepting it. He said it wasn't control since I consented to it. I guess he's partially right. However, it was either me complying or him threatening to breakup, and I loved him and didn't want to lose him over minor things such as social media or clothes. But it is never enough. Control always grows, and he started banning me from activities such as the gym. He blamed it all on our long distance situation and said it was normal for a man to be like this. He even said that if I ever dated a man who didn't feel the need to control me or he overly jealous, that he probably didn't love me and was cheating on me. It absolutely freaked me out.

Or when I drove him the hour to school and back every day when we were together and he spent the whole drive punching me in the arm because he was mad at some teacher for some perceived slight? What about me? What about all the food and clothing deliveries I made to him when he was homeless? The way I delivered a whole guitar to him in the ICU so he could do what he loved best after being in an accident that cost him his legs? The way I took care of him at my own expense for YEARS and was continually abused the whole time?

And don’t even get me started about the fucking guilt I feel for leaving him in the first place. Ugh. His death feels like my fault even though I haven’t talked to him for years now.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,yes,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4000,If you are trying to move out inconspicuously invest in garbage bags.,"I’m passing this along because it’s how I was able to get away from my abusive ex.

If you are afraid of someone noticing you’re moving your stuff out and you’re afraid it could send up red flags here are some tips:

- buy black “yard” trash bags
- put your clothes and fabric items in them.
- the trash bags will hide what’s inside
- if anyone asks, just claim you’re taking things to be donated
- make several trips over several days. 
-if you have to drop the bag at a friend’s house outside in a rush, the bag is waterproof and gives them time to bring it inside.
- vacuum-seal ziploc storage bags work great for making comforters more compact and easier to carry out quickly. 
-take furniture last - it’s the most obvious
- if possible, have a storage unit ready so you can make drop offs.

When I left I began packing trash bags while my ex was home. He’d watch me do it. I’d tell him it was all things the kids had outgrown, or things to clean out. 

He left for work and the neighbors watched me move trash bags. Never anything they could see. I did this over days. When my ex was gone for a long weekend I moved all my trash bags out, suitcase and furniture last. 

This is how me and my children got away. When he came back he was convinced the neighbors were lying and we “must’ve hired movers.” I was just quiet and careful. My kids and I were in another state before he came back. I left our things in storage until I could come back for it.

4002,Help finding resources for mom&kids after leaving domestic violence situation,"I’m a bit embarrassed to have to post this (which is why I’m using a throwaway rather than my main account)... but hoping someone can lead me in the correct direction. To be clear, I’m not looking for any assistance from anyone on reddit, just some advice to find something local/external that could help. I wasn’t sure where else to post/look because Facebook seemed too personal and many people I know irl don’t know about my situation.

I left a really bad domestic violence situation (I have a family court protective order against my ex and he has a pending domestic case, which I could prove to a mod if questioned) with my kids and I’m currently pregnant. I don’t receive child support (I don’t know if it’s even safe to file given the dv situation) and had a loss of one full-time income when I left this situation. Things will eventually fall into place because I’m in my last semester of college and I feel like that’ll at least improve my financial situation.

But... Right now, I’m struggling a bit and was wondering if anyone knew any charities or domestic violence places that I could find some help from. I live in Rhode Island if that helps find something local. 
After fleeing the dv situation, I was left at a disadvantage.
I need help with:
Clothes for my oldest child who is 6 (I have enough of everything for the other 2 but one is outgrowing her current size), help with work clothes for me so I can get to full-time work as soon as possible after this birth, help with an infant carrier/stroller (I have everything else), and help with bills for one month. (Only one month because I want to go back to working asap after the birth, I’m due in March, but I need to take 6 weeks off to recover because I’m having a planned c-section due to the baby still being in transverse position).
If anyone knows the name of any domestic violence agencies/funds, local church or charity or place or anything that could help, please let me know the name or how to find/contact them. I can provide them proof of police reports and protective order filings.",yes,no,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4006,Feeling like I want to go back and just confused and lost,"I am a 21 year old woman was living with my same age boyfriend of 5 years (no kids). A week ago he hit my face pretty badly and I went to the hospital the next day for a CT scan. Nose is broken, mild concussion, whites of my eyes are still bright red, still bruised all over. I never knew when it was coming because the trigger was never directly something I did, I was just his outlet for his frustration.

I left our house with the clothes on my back and sent my boyfriend a text last Thursday morning saying we needed a break and that I was going to go somewhere safe and then I turned off my phone. My mom booked plane tickets for us and took me out of town to visit my grandma, where I am now. I have not logged on to social media or turned on my phone to see what he has said to me since then.

As time goes on I am feeling less like a victim and more and more lost. I don't know what I'm doing or what I'm going to do. I want to go back but I know I might die if I do. My whole life was focused around making him happy and meeting his needs and now I don't know anything anymore. I'm supposed to come back to town in a week.

4008,Angry guy,"I met the guy I am currently dating almost 7 years ago. We have have a rocky relationship since jump. He has broken my phone (on purpose but he paid for a temp one and the replacement), called me names, hemmed me up against the wall, barricaded in the house during an argument if I try to leave, kept me up all night arguing when I had to work. Anyways so in the past year or so this has happened on 4-5 occasions. I talk to his best friend and he is always like oh he’s so sorry he won’t do it again I don’t think he would ever actually hit you. And it’s true he has never hit me. He’s thrown things at me (clothes, liquid, pillows), threw me on the bed and will get in my face and Intimidated me. I just feel I’ve invested so much into him and do a lot for him I can’t get why he does this. I want to get married and have kids and I’m pushing 30. I’ve just invested so much time in this relationship and he just took me ring shopping (before the last fight). Last year we got a call that his step dad assaulted his mom and he was really upset about it. This is the only assault I’ve heard about from his parents. Why do it to me the woman you love if you don’t want it done to your mom?!?

When he has done something to me he most of the time tries to make himself the victim in the situation. This last fight I’m screaming for him to go away and get off me.  He has me by my collar and won’t let me leave, threw clothes and pillows at me, telling me I’m trying to act like a man and I must want to fight him (physical fight) and that I’m aggressively coming towards him (even though I’m trying to leave the house he won’t give me my car keys but I was going to leave anyway). Because of my yelling the neighbors called the police and eventually left then he came to me and said see what you did I feel betrayed that you made the police come even though he was the aggressor. We live in a house together (in my name) and he is away on business a lot. This stint I am finding myself not missing him and wanting to end it but I don’t know how. We have bought a lot of things together that he would take and when he is angry he is a scary guy. He likes to threaten as well. And I’m wonder how I am going to live comfortably and still be able to pay the bills. Then I start to think well he hasn’t ever hit or slapped so maybe this is bearable. I’ve already tried counseling with him and it didn’t work.

4011,Do you think a women’s shelter would let me pay for a Uhaul and come pick me up?,"I have a little money saved up. Finally. I can’t make any calls from my phone because he monitors my call log, so I’ll need to leave pretty immediately after I make the call. I can also pay for a hotel because I know the shelters  don’t have any space right now. I don’t have a car and all my stuff is packed already because we are moving soon anyway. I don’t think he would do anything with a social worker around but he might try to stop me if I try to go by myself. He always has in the past. And I haven’t been allowed to make friends (we just always spend time with his life long friends) AO I don’t really have anyone else I could call to come get me.

I just want to get to a safe place for a few nights where I can make calls in peace and get the help I need, get a job, and stuff like that. I literally just need someone to come pick me and my stuff up. I don’t even have that much stuff just like some boxes of family photos and mementos, clothes, and books that would probably fit in a pickup truck or smallest Uhaul. I have no furniture.

If anyone knows of any service like that please let me know. Or if this is something one of those women’s help centers/shelters would do. This has been the main hiccup in my plans.

4014,So overwhelmed,"I met with a lawyer yesterday and they encouraged me to file a restraining order and said though it could be a difficult case there could be some charges that could be filed as well. I was able to ask questions I have been freaking out in regards to 
 custody things and threats my husband has been using against me. I feel better knowing those answers. They encouraged me to file the order that day before leaving the office. I was so overwhelmed I couldn’t do it. I feel so stupid to feel like I need to have control over this but it’s how I feel. My sister came with me to the appointment and is rightfully concerned because she has distanced herself and heard me shared lots of things that she hasn’t known about. She contacted all of my other family members about the meeting and my father called yelling about making the decision today this minute right now. Then my other brother and sisters called and expressed their frustration and concern with me not going further today. I am so overwhelmed. I’ve recently been taking so many small steps towards change that feel so huge to me. I want to feel in control over my choices and my life and know I’ve done everything I can do. The puzzle pieces seems to be aligning and I’m getting more answers. We are seeing a new marriage counselor and I met with. Him individually today   He is a drug and alcohol therapist she he  told me that he has structure for limited sessions and if the person isn’t willing to get help or address their addiction they will no longer work with them. I felt like that gave me a timeframe. It doesn’t feel like therapy was going to happen with no end in sight. There is a benchmark or light in the end of the tunnel   I just don’t want my family being another person yelling, or demanding, or telling me what to do. Even if their heart is in the right place or if they are scared. I have a plan. Any display of anger or aggression I will leave and file. My keys are with me.

4015,Is this normal?,"Hey everyone. 
First time poster. Long time lurker. 
A little backstory. 
I was in an abusive relationship for 5 years. Physical and mental. We have two kids together. In 2017, we were no longer together, but he came to the town I moved to and held a gun to my head and kept me prisoner in my car.  He went to jail for a short while, but has since been out, then back in, and so on and so forth. Okay now for the question. 
How many of you have huge places of your memory missing from trauma? I don’t remember any of my sons younger years. I find myself saying things like “oh Marley used to do this” (my daughter who is older and born before the abuse got to it’s worst) and my son will ask about his experiences and I just don’t have much to tell him. I’ve lost baby clothes and toys from moving around house to house to escape. I have very few photos it seems. I try so hard to remember these things. I feel so much guilt. Sometimes I go through our places we rented, one by one, and try and remember specific occurrences. But there’s so much trauma hidden behind those memories. So many dirty dishes. Crying babies. Poverty. I went to school and worked full time while he stayed home. Every place we rented ended up destroyed. But I want to remember my son. Are these memories going to come back? Is this a response to unresolved trauma? I do see a therapist and am medicated for MDD. 

I guess I’m looking for advice? Or maybe just some solidarity. Thanks in advanced. 💜",yes,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,yes,yes
4017,He beat me in front of my boys,"Finally last night in a drunk stuppor her slapped me and then held me down and punched me. After the eight time, I stopped counting. I screamed at my boys to run and get my bag. They did and as soon as he let me go we were out of the house and in my car. I drove off not knowing where to go. Couldnt go to my moms because my brother was there and if he saw me all hell would break lose. I went to his aunts house and rang the doorbell, but it was 11:40 pm so there waa no answer. I mean I dont blame them. My mom called and said my brother was gone. I sped to her house and made it there. He got there before I did, bit my mother heald up and old heavy wrench and said if he came near me she would unleash all hell on him. We made it inside and I stayed strong and didnt let my kids see me cry. I have nothing, I dont make enough to replace all of my childrens things. We ran out with the clothes on our back. 

We are all broken. I knew this was coming but I stayed. I thoight it would never escalate, but I was wrong. I didnt call the cops, but I need to press charges. Im so so afraid of what will happen. The court system, my failure to protect my kids. Im a terrible mother. One thing I do know is I will not go back. I will not answer his calls. I will have to fight for custody of my youngest and Im so afraid of him getting custody. I have never been so broken like I am now.

I overcame grief, of my first husband. I am a survivor, I will survive this. I will rise and build myself up, I have too. How will I ever do that?

Im so lost, but I will need to find myself and fix the boys and me.

4018,Ten months after leaving - why is the pain is still crippling?,"I left my STBXH ten months ago. The divorce is finalized in three weeks. I don’t regret my decision to leave (I got out on my second attempt...after the first I stayed hoping therapy and time would help him stop). I have trouble remembering the details of the abuse now. I don’t know if it’s my memory or if it’s just the nature of trauma. He was emotionally abusive, gaslighting, silent treatment. Sometimes physical and sexual - although always inconspicuous, slapping at my arms, pinching, kicking, ripping my clothes off when I said no. 

I’m in such a better place. A safer place. I live alone and took my kitty. I am in therapy (have been for years), have family close. More open about my bisexuality and unashamed. Dating a man who is doting, affectionate, respectful of my boundaries and healing. 

But some days the pain still feels unbearable. The old questions pop up (despite my rational brain fighting against them): why did my husband do those things? Why couldn’t he love me more? Why was he so comfortable hurting me? What did I do to make him treat me that way? Is it because I didn’t visit him at work or wear lingerie enough? 

Sometimes the pain is worse now that I’m out of crisis. I want to process my feelings and grief and continue to heal, but other times I want to shut it all off because my brain still can’t wrap my mind around what happened in my marriage.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,yes,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

4021,Feeling low,"I only had one copy of my custody order so I decided to scan it and print out a couple so I could keep the original safe at home. When I was filing away the electronic copy into my court documents I saw some of the screenshots I took of texts I used when I had my protection order hearing. I read them again which was stupid because they affected me so much. Some of the things he said I put below. They’re not even the worst ones overall because I don’t have all the screenshots on my computer. 

‘I’m coming home do you think it’s really a smart idea to like get me charged up before I get there’
‘You’re used up anyway’

‘I do not care. I hit you because I thought you deserved it. Don’t forget to leave out the fact that you just would not shut up. All the way til you got smacked’

The dresser was something I brought over from my parents house so I would have something to put my clothes in since there wasn’t room for all my things.

4023,Does anyone know of any women’s shelters in any state willing to take a mid-20s woman with no money? I’m willing to take a bus anywhere at this point,"I live in a big republican state so there aren’t many resources for victims of dv and the demand is really high so every time I call any shelters or advocacy groups in the area they tell me they’re maxed out and to keep trying... problem is I only get tiny amounts of time alone where he can’t watch me so I can’t just keep calling every day until there’s a spot. I get one chance every so often and that’s that. If they’re full then too bad for me I have to stay here because there’s nowhere else to go.

If I knew a good shelter anywhere in any state would take me I could borrow enough money from a coworker too get a bus or train ticket there and I could escape. I don’t have friends or family who can help; my family is full of addicts and I’m not allowed to have friends, but I’m sure I could get bus fare since it’s so cheap. I wouldn’t have money after that and would have to start over completely. I don’t even know if I’d be able to get any of my clothes or the few sentimental family heirlooms I have from the members of my family who weren’t terrible, because he may get angry when hefinds out I’m leaving. I might not even tell him but he’s around me 24/7 so that would be hard to leave without him finding out which is what makes this so hard.

Maybe there are states with plenty of shelters and always have openings, i just don’t know because I can’t call them and stuff like that isn’t posted online. 

Anyway, if any of you have suggestions on where I could go, That would help alot. It would probably be a month or 2 or3 before I can actually leave but who knows he may get super mad any time and I’ll have too run away suddenly. These things are unpredictable and I would feel better if I had some sort of plan of somewhere I could go if the worst were to happen and I had to run for it.

On March 1, I was thrown in jail for domestic violence after he attacked me, threw me out of the house without anything, and then called the cops and said I hit him. Since he had a small scratch and I didn’t have bruises I was arrested. It was my birthday. With that came a Do Not Contact where I was prohibited from entering my home. I didn’t see my two young kids for 2 weeks. I am a stay at home mom. This was my first time in jail. I haven’t received even a speeding ticket since I was maybe 21.

April 10th, after my nex texted me for weeks that I could go to the house for food, get whatever u want, etc., he dropped my kids off in summer clothes when it was 60 and we had a hike planned. I went back to the house like an idiot and grabbed my kids jackets. I was there for 5 minutes. 

He had his girlfriend (who basically lives with him now and watches my kids daily) lie and say she saw me breaking in and he said he had a watch missing. I did not take any of his things. 

I now have a warrant for my arrest, have to turn myself in on Monday, for the second time will be in jail bc of his lies, and now have to pay $15,000 in criminal attorney fees on top of divorce fees I already can’t afford. He’s been dragging out mediation dates over and over. He makes 235k/year and I make 40k.

4041,I'll probably never see my dog again after I leave him and it's killing me.,"I'm leaving for an out of state internship in May and after I leave the state I plan on breaking up with my toxic bf and living in that state after my internship ends. I'm not sure if I'll break up with him immediately or if I'll break up with him a few weeks after I leave, but either way the housing I'm provided doesn't allow pets at all, meaning I'll have to leave my dog with him and I'm sure after I break it off he won't give her back. I've tried to break up with him in the past and he's done things like keep all my clothes and important documents and then demand an insane amount of money of me to get them back. I know he's going to hold my baby ransom and it's making me sick. 

I'm not sure if I'll ever get her back after I leave and I don't know what to do. She has helped me so much and is the only reason I haven't had a psychotic break down because of this damn relationship. She lays by me when I cry, cuddles with me when my bf yells at me, stands between us when he starts to get violent. Yesterday we got into a fight because I wanted to stay in the living room to finish a paper instead of going to bed with him, he came up to me really fast and she kept growling at him until he backed away but instead he hit her in the mouth.

- Said I constantly played the victim
- Called me immature/a baby
- Criticized my hair, clothes, friends, and family constantly
- If I didn’t do what he told me to do, he threatened to take time we were supposed to spend together away
- Got upset that I told my friends about how he treated me
- If I said no to sex, he would typically not take that answer and end up feeling me up to get me in the mood so we could have sex
- Told me I do nothing with my life but work, go to the gym, and go home
- Had to ask him to prioritize me with work and grad school one time
- Said he was bored but always shut down any ideas I had for us to do
- Would not take blame when he was to blame (he once took a charger home from my apartment and then blamed me for not watching him pack it. He blamed himself partly too but wouldn’t take full blame)
- Would pick up the phone when his parents called right when they called when I was on the phone with him/talking to him but if my parents called when we were talking, he would tell me to ignore them
- Broke up with me on my first day of a new job

And saw his new girlfriend already has his name tattooed (background, when we officially got together in July 2022 i got his name tattooed not long after…). She had posted pics of them and comments saying they are soul mates and going to get engaged. Ever since I saw that I have been spiraling and wondering if I should have made it work. Gone back when he chased so many times and begged for me to come back. 

I moved out from his house early 2023, covered the tattoo, and even changed my number (my last final last resort) to escape the emotional abuse and occasional physical I endured for too long…unfortunately after all my efforts, he ended up manipulating my emotions yet again, and has my new number. Through text and phone call he can be so sweet and charming. I know it’s a ruse, wolf in sheep’s clothing, but it still, and still, despite my knowing all of this. He has some voodoo hold on me. 

I am much stronger now than I was in 2022 or 2023. I’ve been through a couple therapists. I’m not running back to him every night, or even once a week anymore. He knows I’m not as pliable, but of course he also is well aware of my deep feelings for him.  The last time I saw him was end of last year, and it was a complete moment of weakness on my part that was taken advantage of. Yet even still I had that delusional hope somewhere in my mind that we could be together sometime in the future once we both healed. 

Now he has new girl and she has his name tattooed. He still is texting/calling every few days from random numbers to say that he loves me. That he wants me and how she got the tattoo without him knowing. I keep blocking and he keeps coming back like a cancer.

We started therapy. He was sentenced years of probation with a suspended sentence. He was taking ownership of the abuse. Two years later he is now saying it was 50% my fault and I should have left. How did I cracked my own head twice and choke myself multiple times, fracture my own rib, tear my ACL myself, bruise myself, out a gun to my own head, rip my own clothes off of myself and rip bras in two? I have pictures of everything. I have some sound recordings of his verbal abuse. I started recording things because he said it didn't happen and I needed those things to not feel crazy. Everyone thinks he is a fun loving, smiles, rainbows and unicorn guy. He's not. He is now beginning to attack my reputation in public and I am so tempted to just photo dump everything and tag everyone he knows. I can accept responsibility for some things but I cannot accept responsibility for him abusing me. Please help me understand how to deal with this mind-fsjs and not go crazy.

4058,"I got raped, but he didn’t mean it","Please tell me if I’m crazy. I’m going to go over the basics of what happened. 
He tied me up, with my hands above my head. Blindfolded me. Gagged me. And put earplugs in my ears. He tore my clothes off and started biting me. Hard. I have pictures of over 40 visible bruises all over my body. He raped me. 
But here’s where it gets tricky for me. We were in a kinky relationship, and bondage was normal. But the rest of it, was not.
I begged him through the gag. But he didn’t understand me.
I shook my head no, but I don’t know if he saw.
I couldn’t see him, I couldn’t hear him, I could only feel him. On every fucking inch of my body.
Regularly this would have been fine, hot even. But it’s because he put it all together and I was left completely defenseless, that makes it so hard for me to understand. 
He knew I didn’t want it, but he kept going. He raped me without a condom.
I’m so lost because he understood what he was doing. But he told me so much he would never do something like that.
This still keeps me up at night because he doesn’t see it the way I do.
If anyone asked him, he would genuinely tell them I wanted it.
I didn’t.

4060,My (32f) bf (28m) abused me when i came home christmas night,"
I have been with my bf (28m) for 3 and a half years. 
Im in tears and panicking writing this, i dont know what to do anymore! Today after spending xmas at my nans house i went home and my partner opened the door didnt say anything to me and kicked something in his way i asked whats his problem he was screaming and shouting obviously drunk off his face about how he is going to die and needs a kidney. (All bs) i asked him so many times stop screaming at me. He stomped on me feet, spat at me, pulled my hair to the point im screaming get off me and tried breaking my hand. Anyway i ran out the door and he was trying to pull me back, he was hitting me and trying to push me down the stairs when that didnt work but i managed to run down the stairs and run out the door. He ran back up to get his clothes on and when i was down the corner i could hear him screaming looking for me luckily he didnt catch me and i got a taxi back to my nans house making up a excuse why im back. I cant keep living like this. In september he hit me in my temple with a heavy speaker and i started foaming out the mouth. if i didnt run out today god knows what he would of done idk what to do we live together in a shared accommodation with no kide involved what a christmas day getting attacked. What do i do where do i go. He drinks everyday. When he gets really drunk he gets really aggressive and intimidating. He screamed he did not want to be with me and other horrible things. 3 hours later he tried ringing me but i ignored it so he said he is coming down my nans house to talk to me i repeatedly told him 4 times not to come here. He asked me for his £7 that was in my bank and i sent him that and told him to enjoy his night. That was 10 hours ago and he has not messaged me. I know he is drinking and partying but i cant help but feel this is even more gutting that he wont beg me to come back and beg me for forgiveness.

4064,Glad that someday I get to die,"I am grateful that someday I will be granted death. Just knowing that this life will end is giving me hope. It covers me like a warm blanket that my last breath will one day come.
My life has been brutal since day 1.
I was born to 2 very abusive parents. I would get beatings daily. Family knew but back then, people didnt intervene. This was before the internet existed. I would often run to payphones as a child, call 100 (911 in my country) and cry for help. Then I would hide in the bushes. Sometimes the cops drove by but i was too afraid to walk to them.

After a few hours, when it was nighttime i walked back home.

I would sometimes get pulled by my long hair and dragged over the stairs. I would be put in ice cold showers with my clothes on.
I would be made to sit on my knees and beg.

I would get hit so bad that I couldnt sit for days.

I always thought if I did well at school, work my hardest, that I would have a better life. I worked my ass off and paid for my own bachelors degree in teaching.

I worked. As a teacher of 21, I got into A relationship with a man who I thought was soft and nice and good. I was mistaken.

I am now married. I have 2 children with autism and high needs. I often cant work because they have special needs and are often sick. I do it all alone.

He yells at me if I work, because he wants me to take care of their problems. He yells at me if I dont work because he wants more money.
If I ask for help I get beat.
He has a black belt, is very big and very strong. I am physically tiny. I am skinny and small.
He had tried a few times to dislocate my arm, i then fall to the ground and beg for mercy because he asks me to beg him, just like I had to as a child.
I have no family, no money, nothing. There is no help or recourses in my country. I am stuck here, until death releases me.
He choked me,my neck was black and blue.

Maybe he will kill me.

4066,The absolute audacity of this man,"I'm sorry for the 5 million posts, this place is keeping me sane.

So my abuser abused me financially. It looked like different things over the years but most recently we had separate bank accounts. I had no access to his money. He insisted that all bills needed to be paid out of my account - mortgage, house insurance, utilities, groceries, everything the kids needed, everything he needed - like, he would tell me I needed to go buy him clothes and so I would, with my money. We had many, many arguments about this but he always framed it as though I was crazy and it never seemed worth it.

I left him a week today. I couldn't get our teenage kids out so they are in the house with him.

He expects me to continue to pay all the bills on a house I'm not living in! Like, he thinks he should have both of our incomes and I should have nothing!

I'm not talking about paying child support - I have no issue with that. But he thinks I should pay the full mortgage and electricity bill and all of it. And he actually makes more money than I do.

Did I mention that when I left him previously he didn't pay a dime in child support?

4068,What do I do?,"So the relationship with my boyfriend has never been healthy. It has always been toxic. But recently he has become physically abusive with me. Theres been 2 times now in the past 10 days that he has hit me very hard. First time he punched me in the face, the head, kicked me, bruised my ribs, threw me about 10 feet, and banged my head into something. The last time wasnt as rough, he punched me in the back of the head, then slapped me, and spit on me. 

The last time he had hit me was at my job, in the bathroom. I was still on the clock. I was so afraid and was scared to speak up. I finally did, I wrote a letter to one of my managers telling him everything (he is ex-law enforcement). He was the only one I felt safe coming to for this. He pulled me into a “meeting” and started discussing things with me, he has set up a meeting with a sheriff for me to speak to at my job. My boyfriend will come in to my place of work frequently, and where I work you can’t hide anything (no private rooms etc) so he will be dressed in normal clothes, and I will discuss more with the sheriff tomorrow, On what we can do.

This is where I get to the part of “I dont know what to do”. My bf is currently living with me,my daughter, and my mother, in my moms house. We would have to give him a formal eviction notice of 14 days (standard eviction is 30 days, but since he is considered a danger to others it gets shortened)

I am so afraid to give him this notice, Im worried he will hurt my daughter or my mother, or even just do property damage. As well we have no where to stay for the 14 days of this eviction process. I can have my daughters father watch her during this time, but no where me and my mom to stay. We have no money for a hotel (my mom got laid off and im working 60 hours to just barely keep us afloat) we also have animals im the house and im worried he would try and kill them. Im just so scared because he has told me he would destroy my life if I ever tried to leave him.

I just want my daughter and mom safe. I dont care if I get hurt , but I can’t have my family be hurt by this sick man.

Worst of all I still love him and have a deep emotional attachment to him. But I know this must end to protect myself and my family. It just hurts so much I am in shambles, im exhausted and run down.

4076,He got high on shrooms and said he been sleeping with someone," I been with this man through thick and thin. He even did a 3 year prison sentence  and I stayed loyal to him and took care of his family . Including his mom.
He’s abusive ( I’ve been chocked out so many times, I’ve passed out most of the times and woke up to him still yelling at me ) , irresponsible with money, infertile ( probably due to a past std) and has severe anger issues. I have t opened up to anyone about it because of embarrassment. My mother is so proud that I’m married  and I just don’t want to be talked about . 

 I’m a nurse , I wake up 5/6am every day and work 16 hr shifts. He sells weed. Comes in at 12-4am and sleeps till about 2pm.
I’m just so depressed. I’m at the point where I want to hurt myself . Change myself ….like  Why am I not enough ? 


I went out to a concert with my girlfriend from work , I came back home at around 945…10pm. Surprisingly he was there …. Packing his clothes and acting angry. I suggested we go out to the casino , since I was home pretty early and we could finally spend time together .
Anyway , he gets high on shrooms almost every day ….and tonight he admitted to sleeping around . I’m so lost . 

I caught him on escort websites , he watches porn every day….he watches it right before we have sex, he accuses me of doing all kinds of crazy things and sleeping around . I knew something was up… my ph balance has constantly been off,  out of nowhere . Every time we had sex I would get BV. Even his sexual performance changed.he doesn’t t have a strong erection like usual. I assumed it was porn.

Anyway. He’s gone and packed some of his things . The rest are on the living room couch. I’m left here feeling fucked over once again. 


What do I do from here ? Why is this happening? Should I try to make it work? I’m just LOST . idk what I did in the past to have this dark cloud over me … questioning my existence!

4077,Financially abusive fiancé : It’s over for good .my final update,"Thank you for everyone reaching out to me. 
I have closed in on a little apartment for myself. I got a puppy.

After being in a home where I was truly loved: my parents I realized how sad, cold and alone I had been. Over time I went blind for a lot of things.

Blind to a comfortable home temperature. Comfortable with thinking about every penny spend. Feeling guilty for buying that dress I wanted for so long that was finally on sale. Feeling entitled for wanting date nights… being treated sometimes. 

I started to think about what makes me happy. I love to travel, dress up to go to a nice restaurant. Throw dinner parties, entertain people, think about Christmas gifts 6 months in advance. Have a cosy house…. And I realized just how much he had taken from me with that one little sentence: is that really necessary…

Is anything ever? If you have a roof, food, bed and a TV you are there right? Is travel necessary? Is having nice clothes necessary? Is a shower necessary? A haircut? A party? A hobby? A wedding? No! 

I know now that abusers are not per definition bad people. He is broken and he has trauma I have no time or energy for. He got free from abuse and decided to become the abuser. I know he is in therapy and we initially agreed on 6 months no to low contact. But I felt I was certain it was not for me anymore and I didn’t want to keep him dangling.

Breaking up with him was very hard. It made me very sad. I never wanted to hurt him and I loved this man very deeply. I wanted us to be each others happy ever after. We both came from dark places and I wanted us to thrive together. His family told me I was the one, I was everything he was looking for and I felt so lucky. 

But we only have 1 life and he has so much work to do before he even becomes the bear minimum of what I needed. 

I feel failed. Like my story has a bad ending. I feel very broken and sad. I will take my time to just be me. I hope he does the same. I truly hope he finds the one and becomes happy. Mostly I hope that for myself but for now I am enough by my self with the pupper! 

Thank you all for your time and support. I am going to have a little cry in some furbaby’s fluffy fur",irrelevant,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4081,I’m finally out and it is so bittersweet,"Hi! So good news first: I’m out of my abusive relationship. It finally happened, earlier than I planned, but with better outcome. He slashed his tire and keyed car and then called cops trying to frame me into it. He also changed the locks and took all my clothes, shoes and our child. Long story short: cops found AirTag in my car!!, registered on his phone number, he also had paperwork from AirTag on his car seat (moron). Cyberstalking-> jail and Protective Order for me. Actual court was a nightmare, because he had a lawyer and accused me of all the worst thing’s possible. It was a living nightmare and probably one of the worst days of my life. Judge didn’t buy into it and now I have 1 year DVPO. Working on custody case right now. I’m super happy because my life wasn’t so peaceful in a long time, but at the same time I spent so much money I am broke, have no support, no family and little friends to help. I am struggling so hard and just couldn’t pay my rent in full (waiting for nonprofit to help with the payment but it takes some time). I know everyone says it’s hard to leave, but it’s even harder after when you have no support. I’m happy because my life is not at danger anymore, but it’s so hard to be a single parent. And the guilt of being a failure parent to my child is even worse. I hate the idea we will have to move out after this month because he loves this place and I know it will be hard for him.

4086,Why did he humiliate me so much during sex without my consent?,"Hey everyone.I've recently had a horrible experience and wanted to ask you guys what you think about this.

So this guy that I've been dating for a month said after a date that he had to pick up something from his apartment & that I could come with him. Inside his home, he turned into a completely different person. It felt like he was piercing me with his intense, creepy gaze & that immediately turned me off.

I told him in a polite way that I had to go & he grabbed my arm and told me I wasn't going anywhere. He took off his shirt & said that I'd have to deal with 'serious consequences' if I didn't do what he said. He gave off serial killer vibes (i hate to say it) & I was scared of him.

He started off by humiliating and insulting me. It was as if he was targeting my worst insecurities. E.g. he said that he wouldn't even sleep with me if I was the only woman left and that I'm unattractive to all men. Actually, he said even worse things that I don't want to mention. This nightmare went on & on and once I was totally devastated & humiliated, he aggressively pushed me on his bed. He referred to me as his 'toy' and then he just did it..

When he was done, I couldn't wear my dress because he had ripped it. He was delighted about this & laughed out loud. Fortunately I had an additional dress in my bag because I always carry 'emergency clothes' with me. When I headed to the door, he threw a 5 dollar bill at me & thanked me for the ""good time"".

It confuses me a lot. Why did he humiliate me and tell me all these mean things if he wanted to sleep with me? It doesn't add up?! Why did he call me unattractive etc. if he was the one who pushed for sex in the first place? Did he humiliate me like this because he found me unattractive?",irrelevant,no,yes,yes,yes,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,yes

4097,Growing Pains After Leaving an Abusive Relationship,"I feel like it takes a while to find yourself again. To gain back your independence, identity, and presentation after leaving an abusive relationship. Especially when there are people telling you your experience didn’t happen. Especially when people try to make me question my own memories and thoughts. 

But I know the truth, and he definitely knows the truth. It’s hard to come to terms with the fact that he still thinks he has control of the situation. My situation. My life. 

The most important thing to remember is that I am in control. I have my own identity and I have my own story. My own responsibilities and ideas. Even if it’s taken time for me to finally come back to them. To finally clean up the mess that he and I made. 

Having PTSD is nothing short of exhausting. I constantly feel as though I’m still in that relationship. I constantly feel him around me, lurking and denouncing my independence. Even though I know I’m not. Physically I’m here. Physically I’m about to be a masters student with ambitions and goals. But mentally, I’m still a 20 year old girl stuck in a terrible relationship that made her so depressed she was physically ill. 

But I battle it everyday. I battle it knowing that I don’t want to let him be apart of my life anymore. Knowing that he has no say over my identity. I do. That’s it. I get to say who I am, and I get to say what happened to me. I get to decide who knows and why. 

I get to wear my clothes and stay with my hobbies. I get to have friends who care about me. And I mean really care about me. I have the luxury of being able to reach out to people when I’m down and them lifting me up again. I’m 22 years old, and I know who I am. As much as a 22 year old can. 

It’s difficult to realize that I am on my own and that I have to trust my own decisions. My instincts are entirely out of whack, but they’re all I’ve got. All I can do is learn how to love again, and show my 20 year old self that we will be okay. She’s still apart of me, but she will learn how to live too.

4107,How do you leave?,How can I leave. The other day I was cleaning up the office where we store all of our luggage and in one of the suitcases I had stuffed it with a bunch of clothes in case I ever need to walk out and go. However I unpacked it in a moment of guilt and felt like that moment will never come. I always feel like maybe it's not bad and I should just stay. I tell myself it could be much worse. I constantly think maybe I'm just exaggerating everything and everything is my fault. But I have these moments of anger and resentment. I never felt like that before I realized everything. Just how can I leave when the only family I have lives nearly 2000 miles away. I've gone through the motions and debate of leaving countless times and I always tell myself it's not worth it to leave. But lately I'm starting to notice a pattern with my husband and everytime he comes home on Friday he wants to drink. When he drinks he's like a totally different person. And I can't stand to be around him. Mainly because I know once I get tired and tell him I'm going to sleep he will berate me and manipulate me into staying awake for another 30 mins which turns in 3 hours. I no longer enjoy weekends together and feel extreme relief once the week rolls around. It feels wrong to feel like that because I know I should be excited to be with him but I don't. I get a sick feeling in my stomach when he wants to drink and I feel like I'm waiting for the balloon to pop. I'm scared to leave to be honest. I don't know what he'd do. I don't know if he'd break down and act like he's the victim or if he'd get violent because he's shown before he can do both. The last time I was near to leaving when he smacked me in the face. I couldn't leave because I was drinking and didn't trust myself behind the wheel. He balled his eyes out as if he was the real victim in that situation like I was the one who hurt him. It was the first time I ever felt real disgust for another person. But ever since I've found no reason to go. I have a dog so I also know how hard leaving can be with a pet. I have made a couple friends but I'm too afraid to put them out it feels inappropriate. I just feel like leaving isn't an option. As much as I'm tired and exhausted from everything I feel like I can't leave. And no I won't go back home. I won't let him get that satisfaction if I ever do leave. I just feel right now I can't.,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,plausibly,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred
4114,Reassurance - violence,"So, I’ve just blocked my on and off again partner after he ‘punished’ me with 2 days of the silent treatment.

I’m currently 5 months pregnant with his child, that he demanded to have. 

This isn’t the first time he’s used the silent treatment to punish me, but I certainly hope it’s the last. 

A brief outline of the situation:

Belittling, demeaning, insults, control even down to my diet before and during this pregnancy. Only allowing me to wear makeup and nice clothes in his presence. Demanding screenshots of conversations, constant messaging and phone calls to know where I am, tracking using life 360 and find my iPhone. Nothing I do is good enough and everything is my fault, even down to his abuse, he says I have to take responsibility for his actions. Violence, but not during this pregnancy so far, he’s a strong man and has thrown me across rooms, locked me out, hidden car keys, smashed two phones, strangled me on 3 occasions.

The last incident took place two weeks ago, he stole my phone ( he’s obsessed with going through my phone) and I snapped and called the police, having always covered for him in the past I was transparent with the police this time. They reported everything to social services (unbeknownst to me, loved ones I had isolated myself from had made police reports too) and social services had lots of information I hadn’t given them. Anyway, the social worker advised me to get a restraining order, make sure he’s not on the birth certificate etc for both my well being and the baby’s.

4120,Is my (25f) boyfriend’s (29m) reaction when asking for clarification concerning?,"My boyfriend and I were walking and passed a German Shepherd standing on the porch. He said ‘look at that nostalgic Shepard’. Obviously confused, I asked ‘what do you mean?’ He replied ‘It’s just standing there, watching and not barking.’

My boyfriend mixes up words a lot. I realized at that point he probably was thinking of the word majestic. In the past however, when I outright say ‘oh do you mean x’, he get upset and offended and accuses me of acting superior to him (which is never my intention- I just read a lot as a kid and I know how he thinks so I understand his little mix ups). So this time, I tried to gently nudge him to realize he was using the wrong word and correct himself by saying ‘how does that remind you of the good old days?’

Y’all. He lost it. Got very worked up and aggressively asked me what I meant by that and why I was interrogating him. I gave up and asked if he meant majestic, which he confirmed he did. When I asked why it had upset him so much, he brought up that I knew his ex had German Shepards and he felt like I was accusing him of thinking of her. 

I didn’t even know what to say. I’d completely forgotten she had shepards. We’ve been together 2.5 years, lived together for a year, and they dated for 18 months three years ago. It wasn’t even a thought in my mind. I’d been a little jealous at the start of our relationship because he had so many remanants of her (Polaroids, love letters, clothes, phone photos, art projects, etc) as they’d only broken up a few months before. I got over that once I felt our relationship was serious and that he was actually over her. I haven’t thought or talked about her since before we moved in together. This is so out of the blue for me, and I’m wondering if he’s been thinking about or even talking to her. 

He’s given me the silent treatment since. I can’t believe I’m even posting about this. The entire thing feels so silly but we’re sitting in different rooms not speaking, and apparently the planned dinner and movie dates for tonight are canceled. I’m so worried and don’t know what to think or do.

4121,My boyfriend (27M) thinks that I (26F) wrote nasty things about him in an anonymous Reddit post. I never did. Should I try to explain myself or is it just not worth it??,"Sounds ridiculous but it just happened.
We both browse through Reddit. There is a sub where people can write letters, poems and stuff that actually were never sent or that you never got the chance. I looked into this sub once through his phone.

Last night he sent me a screenshot of one of these letters and nothing else. The letter's title was, ""You disgust me"" and basically was a person ranting over their ex. I took the time to read the nasty letter and while I thought it was a way for the writer to anonymously vent and actually feel better after a painful breakup, I had nothing to do with it. 

In the letter it says that the writer was cheated on, lied to and treated far worse than they deserved. They went on to say that the ex always smelled bad, had shitty taste in music and wore clothing that screamed daddy issues and substance abuse. I will stop here because I think I gave away too much and obviously this person wants to remain anonymous, otherwise they would not be using Reddit.

The thing is, my boyfriend and I actually joked about his taste in music and the daddy issues thing hits far too close to home. Also, he has a past of substance abuse. He's quite an insecure guy and I think the coincidence got to his head.

4128,Why have I  become more insecure since dating my boyfriend ?,"I [20F] have been dating my boyfriend [21M] for just over a year now and we are long distance. When I was single I was super confident in myself and how I looked. I would’ve never considered myself as someone with low self esteem.

However, since getting into a relationship, I feel that I’ve become very hyper-fixated on my looks. I grew up in a household where it was pretty normal for your looks to get commented on, whether that be to do with makeup, clothes, weight, etc. so I definitely think that impacted how important I find my own beauty to be. But now I feel like it’s a completely different level:

I often feel like I’m not pretty enough. My boyfriend always tells me how gorgeous he thinks I am, always hyping me up and complimenting me. But my brain has seemed to convinced itself that he’s lying, and that he’s just saying that not to hurt my feelings (I’m aware this sounds ridiculous bc why would he date me if he felt that way, I just can’t seem to convince myself otherwise). He also lives in Australia and I live in the UK, and so the girls over there are tan, have nice clothes, amazing instagrams, whereas I’m pale, the winter season has really affected my mood, and I just don’t feel like my confident self anymore. 

I try my best not to express these insecurities to my boyfriend too often as I understand how exhausting it can get to be around someone who is insecure or needs constant reassurance. But I’ve been feeling this way for months, always comparing myself to other women, and I just don’t know what to do. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I have to buy new clothes, makeup, skincare, gym membership, hair products, etc. (and as a uni student I can’t afford all of this) to change the way I am rather than work on myself to love me for me. 

I don’t understand why this happened once I entered a relationship…shouldn’t it be the other way around? You feel more confident and beautiful? Maybe I feel this way because I think that he’s surrounded by beautiful girls all the time, but I also wouldn’t say I’m scared he’d leave me for any of them, so I truly don’t know what it is!

4136,I (28F) have been depressed for a year with my (26M) Fiancé due to separate love languages. Will it ever work?,"I (28F) have been depressed for what seems like a year now with my fiancé (26M). Within this year, is the first year of us moving in together and a total of 3 years all together. I wasn’t always depressed with him; However, I became a stay at home mom and I hardly ever leave the house. My love language has always been physical affection and touch, but I’ve been scraping by on just gifts and acts of service. I understand he does work very hard daily to provide for us, but he kisses me once a day sometimes and it gets hard. He is the type of person who wants no affection and to be left alone to decompress. He lacks excitement when he gets home and I get excited to see him because he’s the only adult human I have contact with. I gave in and decided to give him space and have suffered just the one kiss a day for weeks.  He also only finds me attractive and desirable if I’m doing chores, so that’s where his love language comes in “acts of service”. Lately, I haven’t been able to do as much tasks as before as my energy is depleted. Everyday in the beginning, I would bake loaves of bread, clean the house spotless, have a huge dinner ready for him, a back massage whenever he asked, be dressed up nicely, and a towel and fresh clothes ready for him. After awhile, I slowly stopped because even if I did these things he’d still be kept to himself, lack affection, and standoffish. So began the cycle of me doing less because I’m burnt out going above and beyond and it never really mattering at all and he then is put off because of his love language isn’t met, but I stopped doing it because my needs aren’t met. It gets bad and we had sex maybe once a month for awhile(which is all but two minutes), so you could imagine it wasnt even worth it but I crave any form of intimacy at that point. After about a year, things haven’t changed even after multiple conversations about it. I’m currently going to therapy and looking into medications because I also have severe anxiety I deal with again. He doesn’t understand that I don’t care about his money or gifts or doing the dishes for me if he just twirled me around, sat down and had a deep conversation, or if we had a sex life I would bake 100 loaves of bread a day and do anything he asked. I’m starting to wonder if I’m the long run we’ll ever be compatible or maybe if it was a different person he’d actually be more willing to be affectionate?

4141,My(22F) Husband(21M) made a comment about my confidence boost. Was it intentionally an insult?,"Throwaway in case he knows my main/comes across this subreddit.

I went to the gym earlier today for an hour by myself as my husband stayed home to play games. I came back to him telling me to get changed as he wanted to go walking together.

I took a shower, got dressed into one outfit (t-shirt and stretchy pants), and as Im doing my hair, he mentions wanting to change into shorts. I wanted to join him so I changed into another outfit (tank top and shorts) and as I mention a confidence boost, he tells me I should add a jacket or button up and later wanted to change the shorts because it was ""too much black on black"". I change back to the first outfit after not being able to put on the shorts because of the shoelace belt being tied too tightly and getting frustrated from the changing.

We walked out of the apartment, walked to the grocery store nearby, and as we're walking back, he tells me he remembers a post he saw of some ""woke male"" talking about ""Shes not wearing it for herself, shes wearing it for attention and she knows it"" or something like that.

I genuinely cannot tell if he meant this as I was wearing it for attention with him trying to add a jacket and different shorts or if he was understanding that I didnt want to wear it for attention and it was an actual confidence thing (The tank top wasnt showing cleavage and the shorts werent that short)

TL;DR: Got a confidence boost after going to the gym, husband wanted me to change my clothes around, got frustrated and changed out of a set I liked, makes a comment of a post he saw of ""Shes not wearing it for herself, shes wearing it for attention and she knows it"", I dont know if he meant it intentionally or as a passing thought",cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4143,I (34F) just ended a relationship with my expert DARVO-ing partner (32F),"I (34F) was with my partner (32F) for four years and I'm just feeling so many emotions about our tumultuous relationship and recent breakup. My ex-gf  was an expert DARVO-er. It was so incredibly toxic, traumatizing, and confusing. The gaslighting and emotional abuse just made me so angry and resentful. An example of a common conversation:

Me: Hey, I smell cigarette smoke on your clothes. Have you been smoking?
S.O.: Why are you always so critical of me? You've got your own sh**, too! Own your sh**, ____! Own your sh**! Stop accusing me and blaming me for everything! 

At which point, she would break down and start crying on the floor and act like the victim. The issue would never get resolved and I'd feel like a terrible person for even thinking that she'd hide something from me (which she was hiding / lying about many things). And this type of ""argument"" kept repeating itself, just with different topics. 

It's sometimes hard to recognize when you're being manipulated in a relationship. It's even harder when the people around you (i.e., family, friends) feel bad for the other person. They see your S.O. as the victim and you as the offender.

I (20F) discovered today that my mom (39F) is dating a married man and she's telling me that I only want to make her feel bad


Hello, to make this text more comprehensive I will create fake names:

Alex = The married man
Jenna = Alex's wife

I really don't know what to do, by glance this could look like it's not of my business but I just discovered this because Jenna reached out to me by Facebook. She found my profile and told me to congratulate my mom because she's a home wrecker, at first I just thought she was delulu and talking to the wrong person but I had a feeling that something was wrong, I talked with Jenna about the situation but I called my mom first and she told me ""I cannot believe his wife is making this, I wasn't interested in him and is really pushy"", my parents (are divorced and one of the motives was cheating by my dad, obviously I was thinking ""Jenna is just mad and trying to blame other people instead of accepting that his husband doesn't want to be w her"".

My mom always date in secret and doesn't want us to know anything so I didn't know about Alex until Jenna texted me and apparently he's been dating my mom since October, but this is weird for me, my mom and I have distanced since the divorce because she's been wanting to be a teenager again and even started to steal some of my clothes without saying anything. Turning back to Jenna, I told her this was probably a misunderstanding and that my mom would never do that but she sent me the screenshots of the conversations between my mom and Alex where she clearly says that she know this is wrong and she doesn't like to hide but she loves him (remember that she previously told me the opposite of that).

I was really disappointed and talked w mom about this to know her side of the story but it's clear that she knew he's married to Jenna, my mom even told me to talk w Alex if I wanted to because I was delusional. It only took me less than 30 min. On call w him to know he wasn't even divorcing and he's been living w his wife for more than 17 years, and they've been doing any kinds of stuff together.

I don't know what to do, my mom always told me about this kind of stuff but I can't understand this situation, please help me, this is too much to process and it was very obvious that he wasn't even divorcing.

4146,"I (f24) overheard my fiancé (m29), sister, and brother discussing how “spoiled” I am and how much a “diva” I am, how do I stop this from hurting my feelings?  ","  This has honestly hurt my feelings so much, I’ve actually decided to post here to see what others think. Perhaps I’m being overly sensitive or something, I don’t know. 

  Basically a few nights ago my siblings were all hanging out at my house. I have sister and three brothers so it was a lot of us (I’m the middle sibling). 

  My sister and eldest brother were talking with my fiancé outside. They didn’t know (I think) that I was in the kitchen making more drinks for everyone and that the window was open. I heard them talking about me. It started by just my sister, complimenting my ring. My fiancé said thanks and she asked him how much it was. He told her and she laughed saying that I probably asked for such an expensive ring, right? He responded by laughing and saying no. Then my brother starts to talk about how I’m so “spoiled” and that even when we were growing up I always wanted the fanciest things (I don’t even think that’s true). 

  That’s when my fiancé started, and told them that I’m still like that but he doesn’t mind. They then went on to discuss me, my clothings choices, pj choices, makeup, and hair, and my eyelash extensions, for a good 5 minutes (which doesn’t sound like a lot but it felt like forever). They were laughing and maybe it was supposed to be lighthearted, but it hurt me so much. 

  I don’t want anyone to think I’m spoiled or a brat or anything like that, in fact I’m not. I didn’t tell anyone I heard them and when my fiancé asked me what was wrong I just brushed him off.

4156,"Separated under one roof, how to survive?","I was with my ex for 2.5 years, we've been living together for the last 6 months. On Christmas Day he admitted to cheating with a co-worker... well he admitted to cuddling, then the next argument he said it was kissing. And then finally he admitted on the 27th of December that it was sex. So I guess the 27th is our official breakup date.

I'm struggling.... this breakup and my moving out feels like it's happening so fast? The cheating happened a couple days before Christmas. We break up... and now he's staying over his co-worker's house, getting ready with his new clothes and putting on cologne and packing an overnight bag while I'm still here. I'm 100% trying to leave, viewing rooms after work 4 out of 5 days last week, and 2 rooms this weekend. What gets me, is that he can't even wait until I've moved out of our rental. His co-worker is moving to the UK for a working holiday at the end of the month, he said if he doesn't get with her now then he won't get a chance. He says I should be happy he doesn't bring anyone back here to our place, and that he must do this because he needs to get off.

Our relationship wasn't perfect... last month we only had sex once. Its not good enough. Ive been so stressed, and focused on my new job, cooking and cleaning, and the lead up to christmas etc. He works 12 hour shifts, so I ended up assuming a lot of the responsibility for keeping our home going. 

He blames me saying it's my fault for rejecting sex with him, thats why he cheated. I blame myself too, things needed to change - the sex, but also the distribution of responsibilities. I felt more like a mother than a girlfriend. But I didn't get the chance to work on it. I would have done anything to make it work because I truly love him.

4161,Update. Husband made fool of me,"Tyvm. For everyone's caring I'm really humbled God will bless you all.

I've decided I'm going to do what you say. Decided there will be no meeting and no direct contact. Forwarded everything to his mom and dad last night. She called me this morning very upset. Fil knew about the affair. She didn't. He lied and said I was cheating with Bil and went to stay with him with my son. She was very upset and is fighting with fil, she said she understands why I'm doing what I'm doing even though she prefers it if we were discreet. She just wanted to make sure I won't keep her from her grandson. She's disappointed in my husband and told him. IDK what she said to him. But he hasn't talked to me again 

My dad was pissed. He called yesterday night and it sounded like he was crying and it made me cry. He kept asking if husband r*ped me and I said no but he doesn't believe me. He shouted at me for not telling him and continuing to protect husband but said he loves me and he'll still come to see me even if there's no meeting. 

Made paper copies of all the screenshots. The man at the store just kept staring at me. I took all the threats to the police first because some of the comments scared me. It took almost 3 hours. They tried to say cheating is not a crime and insulting me is not a crime. That all he did was talk even if it was threats. Bil got angry and eventually we saw a higher up. He said the most they could do was open a docket with all the information which I can take to a lawyer later to help with the case. But since he never hit me or hit my kid there's no crime. They said most they can do is if he damages my stuff for destruction of property. Tbh IDC about my clothes and stuff but if it helps build a case against him ill do it. Need to find time to send someone else to get my stuff. Just had to fill in forms for legal aid. Since I'm legally married to a man with a good job and have my own account they said I might not qualify for aid but they'll reach out when someone takes the case. I had to pay to pay for ""consideration"" but I should expect a call in a week.

Apologized to sis and bil cos I feel like I've gone from depending on husband to depending on them. They keep assuring me but I feel bad.

4165,Husband on dating apps for 3 years.,"We have been together for 9 years and married 7 months. We have a 5 year old and a 1 year old. 

I have one question for all of you. Why would my husband put the following information into MULTIPLE (7-8) dating websites over 3 years if he was never interested in sexting other people or meeting up with other people for sex? Information he put into these websites were Profile picture, into- fucking, jerking off, oral (swallow), interaction- cum & go, health practices- protection on, vers, bio- I’m new to the bi stuff, bio- no std’s, looking for- men women and couples. 

He claims he was just bi curious and put this information into the app to see more nudes and or videos pertaining to his interests he applied to the app. He claims he was not trying to initiate sexual conversations with people or meet them. He claims he was just looking for porn on these sites. He claimed he put this information to “talk about these interests because he wanted more information from a gay person to know if he was bi or not”. He knew he would get nudes but had no interest in “returning the favor”. He did tell me he messaged a male a picture of his lower half (clothed) then a picture of his face. He also said he replied “nice” to a picture of a nude from this same person “but that was it”. 

So tell me. Why would he put interests “fucking, jacking off, oral (swallow), single, cum & go, single, PROTECTION ON, vers (top or bottom) and mention that he has no STD’s MULTIPLE times if he wasn’t looking to make a personal connection with someone via messages or meeting up to have sex? 

I don’t believe he put this information into the app “just to talk about these subjects”. I believe he was trying to or did cheat on me physically. & if he didn’t cheat on my physically I do believe he cheated on me via sexting these people. I mean I consider being on these websites and messaging that one male cheating but I believe he’s hiding and lieing his intentions.",yes,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

He has refused to answer and phone calls or texts from me. I learned from a mutual friend of ours that he’s in some hotel with her. He just got a promotion that I helped him prepare for.

The AP told me she met him in July of 2022 and went on to see him until Feb 2023. She sent photos of just him in her house. Nothing sexual. But putting on his shoes, sitting on the bed. Everything clothed. She claimed he told her he wasn’t married. I saw messages from him asking when he could come see her. She told me the stories he shared about his life. All lies, but they reflected details of his desires that he’s shared with me. I saw his phone location at her house in October of last year. I was told it was a male coworker, but he would never call or text me back while at that location. She claims they had sex 20-30 times over 8 months. Dates that she gave with pictures all lined up to days he did not sleep with me. 

I confronted him and he immediately denied everything. As the conversation progressed he asked for a divorce and left. The next day we talked about what happened. He claims she was just a friend. He doesn’t remember how they met. (She mentioned a dating site) he deleted social media that he used to communicate. Snap and TikTok. And cried about the terrible husband he’s been and wants to make our marriage work. Still denies ever cheating. 

I’m not an idiot. What cause does a stranger that didn’t know about me have for lying about having an affair? Adults don’t just go over to the opposite sex’s house and hide it from their spouse. They don’t save their phone number in notes. They don’t delete every text. He said he’ll say he slept with her if it makes me feel better, but he didn’t do it.

However, I find comfort in reading the posts here every night before I go to sleep. The full story of the end of my 14 year ""marriage,"" are in my post history. The Short version is that I was completely blindsided and left over night for an AP she had just met (we are both females) and started an affair with a few weeks prior. There was no break down of the relationship, we were trying to get pregnant, she still wrote me love notes in my lunch everyday, and we were taking vacations and regularly intimate, you would have never thought anything was wrong.

I was literally in shock the first few weeks, after he taking a single bag of clothes and leaving our home and everything else while I was at work with no explanation. I never got an explanation either, just I don't love you and I'm done. I got into therapy, I go weekly, I started going to the gym, started new hobbies that I enjoy, spend time with family and friends. I set goals for myself.

I still love her, even though she has completely broken me and my life, and has done unforgivable and terrible things. I hate myself for even thinking about her at all. I feel like I have reached a point of feeling numb and stuck. She is from what I last heard, pleasant as a peach, and here I am just trying to glue back the pieces of myself. I will never understand how someone can just eliminate 14 years of love and their life over night and not think about it at all, be remorseful or empathetic, nothing. It's so cruel, and makes me feel so unlovable, worthless, and unwanted. I keep telling myself that one day this isn't going to hurt anymore, that I will feel better, that I won't have to try to distract myself, that I'll stop thinking about her. When?

4179,When will the hurting stop,"Ok,

So it’s been 6 month since I found out my husband (34m) was cheating on me (32f). I moved out with our 2 kids to live with my parents because i was a stay at home mom and now we have nothing but clothes and a car. He got to keep the house we rented from his mom for obvious reasons, and he moved in his new girlfriend a month after we left. He intimidates me when I ask to get stuff from the house since the court hasn’t determined yet, but he refuses to cooperate with the court. He mom wonders why I’m upset with her, and tells me to just get over it since she’s been divorced too.

I have so much built up anger and sadness I honestly don’t want to feel anymore. I have since got a good job, support my kids, but I still can’t afford a house for 3 people. He hasn’t provided any money for housing his kids, and only gives me a credit card for buying stuff- he micromanages every purchase. The courts are taking forever to get the process started, and it seems like he got everything he wanted while the kids and I struggle.

Father’s Day was the worst. He only shows up when he wants, either once a month or every other weekend. It just ruins me to see his smug face. But this day was all about him- so of course he made it a celebration. 

To add, he was emotionally abusive to our son- still denies him after a DNA test- and gives our daughter all his attention. My son just wants to be loved, and I hate their dad for that. 

He’s also an alcoholic who physically abused me, and I have evidence for the courts- which he fears. I wasn’t initially able to afford a lawyer, and it would take everything I have to get one now. 

How do I remain calm when I have to see him and his mom every other weekend? How to I keep it together when my kids tell me about his new girlfriends pets?

4182,I loved a man who didn't exist.,"As I  write this I'm looking back on my relationship with my ex bf who had clear narcissistic traits. We broke up last month and I'm trying to heal but also grieve. I am grieving a man who I loved but it's clear he never existed. I thought my ex bf was loyal, honest, and had high moral standards.

Turns out he was in a relationship with another person while having an on and off relationship with me for 3 years. He  was also cheating with both men and women, I always had my suspicions he was that busy as I would find women's clothing and a container of almost empty lubricant. Everything was confirmed after I did a bit of investigating because I thought maybe it was just my BPD distorting reality. 

He is a bodybuilder and would constantly make excuses about being at the gym or his health being affected by the steroids therefore he couldn't spend time with me. I knew it was all lies intuitively because at the beginning of our relationship he would always make time for me. 

What hurts the most is how he would lie to me and tell me he's loyal, on top of that he would still have unprotected sex with me. It genuinely scares me how this man would play with my health like that while claiming to love me.

4183,Its been 22 hours since !,"So its been 22 hours since i left my husband. I have never posted more on a subreddit in my entire life. It feels like its not real. He came over but i did not see him. Sister wouldn’t allow it. She thinks he is narcissistic and im suffering from that trauma bond and i finally acted out due to rolling over and taking his betrayal and trickle truth for so long. 

The weather has been a bit chilly and we got some rain , so we got the fireplace going currently. I havent slept. Im not tired. I haven’t ate either. Im not hungry. But im not sad or missing him. I feel completely empty. The kids are sleeping in the guest room. I took the couch for now. My sister has the cloud couch dupe from Bobs. Definitely buying one now LOL. I did some online retail therapy. Got some makeup and new clothes plus a really cute bikini. Im going to enjoy myself this summer. Yea this sucks so bad. I really thought we were forever but the realization that this man was never faithful to me had hit me like a ton of bricks finally today. My kids deserve to see me happy and stress free.

4184,Caught my husband right after I gave birth,"I was married for almost 2 years to my husband (31), but we are living together for almost 9 years. We have kids, 2 boys aged 8 and 3. I was currently pregnant with our last child and gave birth via the cesarian section. I also underwent ligation since we are firm on only having 3 kids.


Before discovering the affair, I was doing a lot better compared to the previous years. He was more involved that's why I never had a clue. The morning after I got home from the hospital, I couldnt find him. So, I went outside and saw our car parked in a distance... I saw him there with a woman. 

It was the same woman who he invited over for Christmas and his birthday 2 months ago. He told me it was his friend's GF. It was his. I saw used clothing in the car and confirmed that the affair was going on for months.

We tried to talk things out but, I still caught them together in a bar and continously communicate. I shamed them online, seeked counselling and now I am diagnosed with depression.

We had a month of bickering on how to deal with the situation with the kids and agreed to co-parent. I just can't figure out how to move on. I want to find peace and heal from all this but every time I see him, doing things for us and trying to make things work makes me feel that we still have a chance. 

My kids are happy to see him. He wanted my help to make him better and overcome his narcissism. I'm already too overwhelmed and I'm not sure what to do anymore.

I also need to work above all these because I had bills to cover and children to feed.",yes,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4190,emotionally and physically drained,"I tried to do a week NC but failed. In my country where divorce is not an option, neither of us have filed. His family, values family and they too are emotionally drained of talking some sense to him about him going back to our family to fix things. He only did IC once and doesnt want to do it again. He just wants to cut everything out of his life. Including his kids... are cheating, abandonment (3rd escape), no remorse or guilt even to his family signs of narcissism? After a round of IC, he was recommended for psychotheraphy because of escape patterns. 

I am seriously emotionally drained. I pity my kids but I dont want them to lose having a father. I think the whole 12 yrs (8 as married) of our relationship is actually based on codependency... I tried to educate my self about narcissism, codependency/enabler, cognitive dissonance, gaslighting etc during a week of NC. 

Now, he's doing NC to me. Cant even look me in my eye. I feel like trash and I just want to disappear. It is overwhelming and seriously too much to bear. 

I am physically, emotionally drained from all the trauma... its been almost 2 months after dday and discard..Due to financial strains i can no longer afford theraphy. I went to gym, bought new clothes bec i realized for 8 years I havent bought so.much for myself so I can support him and the family, I went to salon to get my hair done. But after these, I still feel a hole in my chest.

How can this get any easier.. i understood grey rock but its difficult since we have kids. I am used to me fixing the problem over the years, me trying to show life.. he was a good man, until after the affair happened that he started to treat me..so much worse. I want to get out of this.

4194,My ex husband is manipulating his new gf the same way he did me. And I genuinely don’t understand why she’s not getting it.,"I was with my ex for 6 years about. Throughout those 6 years. It was non stop gaslighting, cheating and manipulation. Followed by physical and verbal abuse  unfortunately I had a child with him. 

Everything came to an end after he called the police on me free I protected myself against him. Which got me arrested.  The trial was long and exhausting but, I proved my innocence.   

My issue now is. She’s still with him. Why? I’m trying to protect another woman from making the same exact mistakes I made. And save her from abuse. Everything’s out there. She knows he’s an abuser and a horrible person that lied on my name. 

He’s isolating her from her family and has gotten her to burn bridges as he did with me. I’ve TOLD HER how he isolated me and how that was the first stage of a life of misery with him.  He currently is charged with multiple counts of assault concerning me as well. 

And STILL she hates my guts and thinks I’m a liar and a jealous woman. She won’t leave him. I told myself I’d fight for any woman so they wouldn’t end up like me. That includes her.  But I feel like this fight is pointless.


This is just an edit to clarify some things: due to a lot of legal battles, and extreme financial strain as I’m in debt because of his actions. As well as him taking all of my possessions (I left with the clothes on my back. He has not given me any of my things. All my furniture.  Clothes. Electronics Dishes— literally . Everything is with him) as well as me having to deal with our daughter and the clear abuse she’s facing when with him. It’s hard to “get over” him.  I am no way emotionally bond to him in the way people are assuming I am. I do not love this man. I have so much anger and resentment towards him for the reasons listed. I went from being able to support myself and my kid to making less than 500$ last me a month. I have no job and can barely even afford clothes to look presentable. Much less warm for the winter because I’m so stricken with poverty because of him. It’s hard to pick myself up.  I wanted to protect this woman along with any others that come his way or just get the word out there, because living this life i am living feels like hell. To where I didn’t even want to be alive anymore. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone.  I had an amazing life.  And he took literally everything I had away from me.

4197,Is this emotional infidelity? Unsure how to deal with this.,"Ok. Been married 20 years. We've got 2 kids. He travels for work. Right now its just to school, which lasts anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 weeks, but most of them have been 2 -3 weeks.   


We'd gotten ourselves into a really bad place before the traveling started, with a lot of arguing and a lack of sex.  


Somewhere around August, he met this woman at school. They hit it off pretty well. Enjoyed talking to each other, etc, ect. I don't love that tbh, but I think having opposite sex friends can be fine.  Well they both commiserated a lot on having sucky relationships. They were going out and doing things  like kayaking and hiking and karaoke (usually with other school friends, idk if any of these things were alone, tbh) I don't think he realizes how much like dating this is. Esp when we aren't (weren't) going out and doing much of anything.   


I've read his phone. He's had some inappropriate conversations with her. Some unintentionally so, some intentionally. Discussing what sorts of clothes he finds attractive, and talking about sex, kinks, etc.   


He's always underlined that he's married and wouldn't do that BUT he has made a couple of comments to the effect of ....If I wasn't married....  I think he's having an emotional affair, but he doesn't know the difference between that and friendship??? I know that because he asked her what the difference was.   


Well in OCT we finally started marriage counseling. We've discussed this situation specifically a little bit, and he's to not talk about our personal life, BUT he thinks they are just friends. (and maybe they are...)   


I don't feel like we've reached a reasonable place on this. But I don't know and also don't want to push him into hiding it either.   


Counseling overall is going great. We are really connecting better overall, having discussions. and when we argue, we are recovering better and better. Oh, and going out again together too.

4203,I need help to cope. He cheated (part 1),"Hi,

I (34F) would like to share my story. I'm hoping to get some support, advice and maybe help other people going through this.

So apparantly his (33M) ex send him a message about 2,5 months ago which he responded to. After them talking to each other for 2 weeks, they decided to meet up. A few days before that, he wanted to talk to me and told me he wanted to end our relationship, bc he felt it just didn't work anymore and that there are too many arguments that don't get resolved (of course he never admitted being in contact with her and that they were going to meet).

He probably wanted to come to terms with himself before doing anything physical with her. Obviously not how that works...

We were together for 9,5 years, have a child together, and we sure have had our difficulties in our relationship, including the last few months.

I always felt that it was just me trying to make our relationship work, I wanted to grow together, move forward.... I never would've thought he'd do this to me. I feel humiliated, in pain and as if I have lost all control.

I knew something was off, you know... that strong gut feeling.

Long story short, I caught them at her house, he didn't open the door, left me standing there. We did talk to each other over the phone. I told him to come get his clothes asap, leave and never come back again. I went home, in shock.

The next day he came to get his clothes and that was it. The hell I am going through had then started. I can't remember much of the 2 weeks that followed (still in schock).

4204,Fell for the hoover. Stayed at his place. Regrets ensued.,"Husband [25M] told me [25F] he broke it off with affair partner after 3 months now. I stayed strong and remained no contact as I had been for nearly a month, but then I stupidly decided to give him a piece of my mind. He then asked if I’d like to try again. I said we could try small steps. He said ok.

We met for dinner. His eyes were lifeless. He said it was just because he was tired. We went back to his new apartment so he could sleep. Some of her (other woman’s) things were still there - toiletries, a letter, clothes, etc. I threw it all out. When we went to bed, he said he didn’t want to kiss or cuddle because it didn’t feel right. He said he “thought” he loved me. Then later, we did end up cuddling.

In the morning, I tried to kiss him and talk, he was so cold and distant. He didn’t want anything physical. He told me looking at me made him feel sick. I said it’s guilt. He said it’s not, and he doesn’t know what it is, but he thinks he has fallen out of love. He said seeing me cry made him feel nothing at all. I said maybe you’re a sociopath since you keep talking about how you are numb to all feelings and lack empathy for others. He said he didn’t think so because he “loved & felt empathy for [me] at a point”.

I should’ve never gone… Now I go back home alone again. Another heart-shattering event with no one to blame but myself. I’m such an idiot. All I wanted was him. And here I am stupidly still hoping maybe he will come to his senses and say he made a grave mistake letting me leave. Ha. Such a chump. 

I can’t even tell my friends or family about it because they’d have my head. They would be so upset, angry, and hurt that I decided to see him. I wish I could just take their advice.

4207,Husband wanted a break from pregnant(7mos) wife,"

I (31F) and husband (29M) are on a break after having had a strained relationship since we found out about my pregnancy. The pregnancy was neither planned nor unplanned (at some point we were actively trying for a couple of years but did not get pregnant, so we decided to let nature run its course). 

He became overwhelmed with this new responsibility, I became frustrated that I wasn't getting the emotional and physical support I needed from him.

I found out about his infidelity (online affair) during my first trimester and he said it will not happen again and that he will work on earning my trust back. 

Time flew by, and he still couldn't decide if he wants to 100% commit to me and the baby. He did not attend any of my doctor appointments and was also not responsive to any of the ultrasound photos.

During my second trimester, I thought we were finally progressing as we had made potential plans to move in together (he used to live at my place then moved back to his parents since end of last year for work) 

Then I found out the same day we talked about moving back in together, he was back to seeking validation from random girls on social media. I asked him what triggered this unhealthy pattern of his. He said he is ""scared, unprepared, and thinks that me and the baby deserve better""

From there it went downhill because my trust was shattered twice, I became paranoid and insecure. I noticed he was glued to his phone, shopping for new clothes, started caring more about his appearance (he even asked me how he can improve on his wrinkles because he feels it makes him look much older than he is) and I thought these were all red flags of someone who is putting themselves out there.

He left me saying he wanted to take a break because our conflict has been going on for months and we are so broken already. He said he loves me and would really want us to work out but he cannot guarantee that either. 

I am currently doing inner work and have been to counselling since the start of my pregnancy when I found out about his infidelity.

Another twist of the story: only my friends and family know we are married (3 years), nobody from his side knows. His parents only know I'm pregnant. So in his world, I am a girlfriend he took a break from.",yes,no,yes,cannot be inferred,no,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,yes,no,no,no
4208,Why are cheaters so manipulative. And why do I still feel hurt after four years…,"Went out shopping and saw my cheating ex fiancé whom is still married to one of the women he cheated on me with. He kept telling me how happy he was for me about a career I had after the split and said he knows I’m engaged now. Then he said that i was his best friend and he tried hugging me. He made some joke but it was more awkward than anything. The only thing that made me feel good about the interaction is that I actually saw him at his old high school job that he hated the most and it felt like karma for him ending up at that miserable job again. He also didn’t brush his hair very well and his clothes didn’t look well kept either. I’m still in shock about bumping into him after not seeing him for five years and how he now looks so different. It’s like he doesn’t care about his appearance anymore which screams miserable or chaotic to me.

Him saying he’s happy for me seemed so fake and him saying I was his best friend hurt too because we were definitely more than just friends… we were engaged and together for almost ten years.

I have been married for the past 18 years. I am 39 so my husband and I have really grown up together. This past November I found out he cheated on me again. This has been somewhat of an issue over the past 18 years. We have been separated since that time. At the beginning of July I met this guy online. We talked/messaged everyday multiple times a day. We obviously connected and I shared with him about my situation and he shared a lot about himself, including his childhood trauma, time in prison and experiences with mental health. This past Sunday I drove four hours to meet him in person. We hit it off in person and hooked up. This is the first person I have slept with since I met my husband almost 20 years ago. I messaged him when I got back home and he completely flipped on me. He told me I was psycho and crazy and to never call him again. He said I reminded him of his ex who lied and called child protective services on him and that he told his lawyer about me……I am just stunned that this happened to me. I don’t understand if this is who this person  was all along and I was just too stupid to see the wolf in sheep clothes? or is this his mental health and not taking medication? I feel so horrible right now. I am just incredibly sad that someone who I thought cared about me could be so cold hearted. How can he have talked to me and invested his time in me if he didnt care at all. Surely there are less effortful ways to find a hookup. Is this now the way of the world? do I need to stop trying to see the good in those that most people would write off?

4221,Update: How do I let go?,"Hey everyone, a couple weeks ago I posted about discovering my husband of 18 years having an affair and how indecisive he was being at the time. Many of you gave me great advice. Original post here:  

https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/w0cizg/am_i_delusional_for_thinking_reconciliation_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Since confronting him about 3 weeks ago, I maintained NC except when communicating about the kids. I didn’t even know where he was staying. It has been excruciating. I spent all these days swinging wildly between utter devastation and despair, some okay moments holding onto any thread of hope, to anger and back again. Sleep is a funny notion at this point. I’ve been trying unsuccessfully to stay busy… it’s been so hard. I can’t focus on anything, especially work. Can’t eat.
Well today, he came by the house to grab some more of his clothes and to talk. He’s been staying primarily at a buddies house, but he is still in contact with AP, still says they are not a “thing”, even now, SMH. Doesn’t matter now anyway. We had a long, cordial talk. I set some boundaries around the AP never
coming to our house or meeting kids yet. I expressed a lot of my anger and hurt and disappointment that he STILL hasn’t had the guts to just say what he wants. To look me in the eye and ask for a divorce. But I did tell him that his actions are telling me everything I need to know, and I see that we are over. We hashed out a temporary plan as far as handling time with the kids and me letting him know when I leave town to care for my parents, so he can stay here. Financially, divorce makes zero sense right now- we both have homework to do to figure that out. I’ll be consulting with an attorney asap.

Guys, he just left about an hour ago and
I feel like I can’t breathe all over again. I feel like not only has he blown up my life, but has erased all the good of the last 20 years together- as if none of it was real. 95% of pictures or memories involve him. I just can’t fathom how I’m supposed to let go of my life just like that and move on. And when I think about starting to tell family and friends I really struggle with telling the full story or not. Part of me wants people to know this wasn’t me giving up or a mutual decision. I want them to know the extent of the hurt he is inflicting on his entire family… and then sometimes I think that’s not anyones business. 
Tomorrow we sit our teen twins down and let them know officially what’s going on. They see it all coming, but want to be clear and make sure they understand and give them a chance to ask questions.

4222,Will it ever be the same?,"It started in mid May I began having some health issues. I saw several doctors until I was finally referred to a specialist. This health issue affected me mentally, physically and our sex life. It was a month since we had sex. 
I never noticed any red flags. That’s the scary part. I guess I was too wrapped into doing my own research to figure out what was wrong with me I didn’t notice my husband was beginning an affair with a coworker. 
One night in the middle of a horrible flare I decided to go through his phone and found pictures he took of his erection fully clothed twice. Both times while I was asleep. I went through the phone records and saw tons of txting from a number. I found in his contacts belonged to a woman. 
I woke him up and he brushed it up at first but then confessed to flirting and sending pictures but said nothing else ever happened and there wasn’t emotional attachment. He just like the attention she gave him because I was ignoring him obsessed with my health research. I felt guilty because I couldn’t give him sex, I did spend all my time and energy trying to figure out what was wrong with me AND I haven’t been able to get pregnant after 2 years of trying.  
We decided to work through it together. I’m trying to be more attentive. He finally took my health serious after Dr. found swollen lymph nodes in CT scan.

He's never been one to cheat, even look at other woman, always found one night stands to be disgusting. Now he's looking up well know skanky woman around our area on FB and befriending them..some of them are barely 20 years old. He has completely disrespected me and trash talks me, and blames it solely on me. Our children are left gobsmacked,  angry and bewildered, although still talk to him..barely.

I had to go through the rest of the abortion by myself as I found out he was trying to go back to his ex. I don’t know how to deal with this. It was so traumatizing & degrading.

I’m willing to try to make this marriage work. But I have no idea how I’m supposed to be normal again. Happy, laughing, having fun with him, comfortable changing clothes in front of him, and of course being intimate again.

Update:
He took yesterday off of work and we went out to a restaurant and just sat…and sat…until I was ready to talk. And he opened up without hesitation and answered the questions I could bear asking and hearing the answers to. It was quite therapeutic. It was a nice start. 
And then today I got an email from the Other woman. With pictures and screenshots of texts. Things I DID NOT want to see. It was what I knew I could not handle. It was not new information, just a punch to the stomach.

He has only given me my clothes, he’s refusing to return the kids clothes and toys. She’s (AP) behind that I believe as she was there pulling all the shots refusing me what’s mine and what he had originally agreed to give me, he has now gone back on his word and won’t. The biggest laugh is she’s controlling him from behind texts etc, she can’t even face me. Keeps hiding away and wouldn’t come out of the house, when myself and my mother was away dropping stuff off at my house and we came back they were away and they arrived back in his car and she wouldn’t even get out of it because i was there. She’s literally too ashamed and afraid to face me. He had the audacity to come out though, I really was afraid of seeing him in person like this but I’m honestly surprised as I thought I would feel completely different but surprisingly I felt nothing. I felt nothing for him. This is good I believe, it means I’m headed towards healing. He literally threw all my clothes in the front garden though, like trash.

I confronted him about it, and to be honest, I ended up getting sick from him confirming what I knew to be true, they even did it on ""our bed"" the one we sleep in now. I'm so disgusted, I feel numb, I just want to bawl up and cry.  the stress and PTSD this triggered from my past relationship my ex-husband ended up leaving me for someone else and I have this terrifying feeling of being alone and abandoned now, I have trying to move forward in the relationship the best I know how, and I am trying to process this, but every time I close my eyes I feel so sick to my stomach and see her picture of her laying in ""our"" bed, bare, naked ass, he has never done anything since, I did admit I snooped and found it, he got very angry, said he can no longer trust me the first time snooping he could forgive but he's saying I'm just dredging up old stuff, In a way yeah, I've known for about 3 weeks now, and it's just getting worse. honestly, at this point, I am starting to feel numb, his reactions about being confronted were pretty angry, and yea. I get it, but you lied to me bro, I can't trust you either.

So, I really don't know where to go from here.  My heart hurts, it's almost Thanksgiving, I have a million things I need to do, but this has got me so fucked up, and he dismisses it like it's no big deal, it was in the past and it has no effect now, WRONG: when my entire foundation I built this relationship on was a lie, you lied, you began to date me under false pretenses, He doesn't seem to understand that and I'm at a loss. I really am so sick of shitty men.

I left my narc 3 years ago and I thought all would be well. I didn't know my now 15-year-old daughter would side with him and prefer him over me. Today she made plans for herself and came to me telling me that I told her she could spend the weekend with her friends. I never told her that and she fell into a rage. I took her phone and that caused more of a rage. 

Things cooled down and I went to do a load of laundry. As I was loading the clothes into the washing machine when she came storming in talking about ""Mike"" (fake name).

My narc ex always talks about him and is always accusing me of cheating with Mike. He has been looking for proof since I've met him. He's still looking as my friends send me screenshots of him asking. 

Anyway, my daughter came in telling me she knows Mike is her real dad. This is devastating to me because I know this is coming from her dad and he must have told her this. She began screaming and crying about a memory she has from when she was 7 when I left Mike and moved in with her dad. She also remembers when I was going to leave with her and move her to Ohio (a few states over) when she was 8. This also never happened.

So I left my narcissitic ex four months ago because he became extremely controlling, uncompromising and paranoid. My life became completely micromanaged by him even if we were long distance. He would distrust me all the time, accuse me of cheating at any text message I would receive, or if I forgot to update him with pictures throughout the day. His control escalated. He not only isolated me from my social life, but also didn't let me post any picture on social media saying it was vain, made me erase old pics, trashed my friends and called them untrustworthy bit***, started getting mad at my clothes (I swear, I don't dress revealingly), didn't let me go to the gym... And nothing I was doing was good enough to him. He always attacked me for not feeling loved enough or appreciated enough. He would always find a reason to create chaos and drama. I thought it might be the distance, but it started affecting my mental health. I was always the girlfriend who chased him, because he would leave me at every argument, but this time I couldn't take it anymore. He also had double standards and many things he banned me from doing, he excused himself for doing them. Only two days after I left, he found a new girl. Now they're around four months together. At the beginning, he still engaged with me trying to ""make this work"" or promising that once he would be back to his country we could make it work. But then, when I told him I didn't want to be his second dish, he started saying he had feelings for this girl and loved her.My last message to him went completely ignored for weeks. I expected not to hear from him again. But I got this to my Gmail today. 

These were his literal words:

""In many ways you were a good girlfriend. It’s sad that it ended the way it did, and perhaps I really did drive you to quit. I’m not idealizing anyone or making anyone the demon. 

I’m not worth all of the time you’ve spent chasing me. My heart isn’t always pure, I can be extremely paranoid and fear driven, I can be prideful, I can be judgemental. I don’t have any money or useful skills. I’m an alcoholic. The list goes on. So move on. I’m not worth all of the heartache.""


I just wonder if this is a real confession and him realising his issues, or if in reality he wants me to prove him wrong by chasing him.

4274,My narc ex was a dietician,"I've always been fluctuating and my mental health is actually correlated to my weight.

Then it hit me. Looking at my history, it's clear that I was mentally unstable, because I grew SO FAT.

I met this guy when we moved in the same shared flat. He was a personal trainer and a dietician. I was a healthy 71 kg when I met him (24 bmi, small muffin top). I had lost the Covid hard lockout fat over the summer, which was about 6 kg.

I was officially obese. All we talked about was cooking and what changes were necessary in order to lose my weight, build my muscle, etc. I was distraught by the figures on the scale, so I stopped looking at them. I ate too much, with him (he was a powerhouse).

During this time that he promised me he would help and I was doing OK, he also love-bombed. Early on, he told me I was dead wrong about calorie counting and that is wasn't the way, etc. 

So, because I had him close by, I didn't follow the myfitnesspal journaling technique. I didn't want to aggravate the pro. But then the pro said he wasn't really willing to take me on. I started lifting and eating, and got bigger, but also fatter. I was a mess.

Then I appealed to my narc ex, saying that I needed my body to not look too bad for the summer holiday we were planning together, and he scoffed and told me it was too late, a month prior. I said I'll starve myself then and he said that's unhealthy, only eat vegetables and chicken for a whole month and that'll be OK. The only advice he gave.

 I couldn't do it. I had started eating konjac noodles what tastes horrendous, everything he said to try had failed. So I picked up myfitnessal afain and lost 6 kilos the first 3 weeks. I said I'm sad I can't loose another six before the holiday (I was still fat). **And he said it was because I didn't do as he said. I got to obesity under his watch.**

**The devaluation started the moment I started losing weight, doing it on my own terms.**

I'm now 69 kilos, the slimmest I've been in YEARS. And I actually weigh less than HE did last time I saw him (grantes, he is dry and musclar)...

There have been many in the past 2 years I’ve been realizing were abuse, most of which have been because my new, amazing husband has been helping me overcome my trauma and heal. I thought I was okay, and figuring out what normal is, and then my husband comes along and tells me not everything is my fault, I don’t have to apologize constantly, it’s okay to say no, feelings are real and he validated them, he encourages me to try new things and do what I like, he has helped me grow and find myself. I never knew relationships like this existed.

Onto my discovery. When I was with my Nex, I didn’t sleep well. He would keep me up until 4 am arguing when I had to be up at 6am. The 2 hours of sleep I would get were interrupted by waking up to him on top of me, having sex with me. I would freak out. He would finish, and tell me that I initiated it, so he thought I was awake. He’d say I rolled over and would touch him in my sleep. I told him several times to be sure I was awake before doing anything and he always claimed he did. I know now he was lying. I always felt disgusting and would try sleeping under separate blankets, wearing more clothes (I never slept nude), putting pillows between us after he would fall asleep. It never stopped or deterred him. I’ve been with my husband for 2.5 years. I have never woken up like that with him. I asked him if I have ever tried to initiate while we are asleep and he said no, never. I lived with 2 different ex’s before my Nex and it had never happened with them either.

I wanted to update you on my life since leaving and tell those who are thinking of leaving to please please please leave as soon as you can. When it’s safe for you. Run and don’t look back. Seek help. Get out.

I left in January and it was the worst pain imaginable. I didn’t eat, cried, cried, cried, didn’t sleep, thought I was going to die of heartache. I didn’t let myself go back, for me and for all those I would have disappointed if I had. So many strangers here and people I barely knew came to rally for me giving me food, clothing, furniture. I made it out.

My life has completely turned around. It hasn’t been easy but I’m getting there. I now found a full time job in spite of the pandemic and my boss loves me. Says how quick I picked up on things and how glad she is to have found me. (I’m her assistant). I joined CoDa and attend weekly meetings virtually until we can reopen. I smile more. People have told me I look happy. I can speak with people without fearing that I’m stupid or being judged. I buy what I want. I dress how I want. I started to wear my old jewelry again that he didn’t like. My old clothes he didn’t like and people are complimenting me on my style. I feel more peaceful than I ever have. I’m learning to love myself. I asked a man out for coffee. Ok, it’s not a date. I’m not ready to date yet. But that’s ok. He has a gf so it feels safe. Just a chat with a friend I hadn’t seen in a while. I asked and he said yes. I didn’t care if he said no. I’m learning to live again. I’m reconnecting with people I haven’t seen in years. Being on lockdown has helped me reevaluate my life and what I want. Now I want to be more social. 

There are dark days but they are further and further apart. People like me. I’m not fucked up like he said I was. Im not stupid. I’m not afraid of being liked or not. I’m not afraid of driving alone.

He is also extremely insecure and has repeatedly accused me of talking to other men, cheating, he also called me immoral once for an interaction I had with another person - before my current boyfriend and I even met in person (he was jealous). 

He’s also extremely critical and very picky about how things are kept in our space. He doesn’t think of things in the context of team work or partnership, he’s very singular in his thinking. For example - this is stupid but an indication about how he acts. We had a disagreement, he had said he’d take out the garbage, then didn’t, and I subsequently cleaned up the house and left the garbage in the front hall. We live in a remote location and don’t have curbside bins for pickup. There are also bears, so we can’t leave trash outside. I had a busy day and was unable to get my son to school, drive for my long commute to the office and back, pick up groceries AND take the garbage out. 

He came home and started criticizing me about leaving the garbage there, despite me cleaning the entire house and trying to make room. 

He blames me for issues that he creates.
He’s picky about his laundry.
One time I left his damp clothing on top of the dryer. He was furious and excoriated me for days about it. He was still bringing it up recently.

Then the other day he did the same thing for me and my sons stuff, and when I expressed annoyance he was super rude and dismissive. To me the laundry thing wasn’t a big deal in the first place, but now it is because I feel that it’s a double standard.

That’s just one example of double standard type things he does. He can act/do/be/say whatever he wants but if I do the same I’m something horrible.

Hi! I am sorry but I really need to talk about what I’m going through because I am too ashamed to talk about this to anyone in my life.
When i was 18 I met this guy, we had a relationship that lasted one year after which i broke up with him because he was very abusive. We stayed apart for a year and a half right when the pandemic started. During this time he went to a therapist, started working, it looked like he changed a lot. At some point i was misdiagnosed with cancer, even though i am ok now, it was very difficult. He reached out to me and he was by my side, so i decided to give him another chance. After a few months, things got weird. During fights, he started yelling at me so loud and telling me that i act like a wh*re because i annoy him, that he should break up with me and leave me some cond*ms to f with other guys (i never cheated on him, i didn’t even talk to other guys as i know he can be very jealous, but when we were apart i had a very short relationship 7 months after we broke up, i was just trying to get my life back together, back then i never wanted to see him again). He also calls me stup*d when we fight and I think it is weird that he doesn’t want me to wear certain clothes when i am not with him. 
I feel manipulated and abused by this point and i am too scared to break up with him because even the fights are terrible, he swears, packs his things, leaves , and then comes back a couple of times before getting calmer.
I am too scared to tell anyone about this because i feel so du*b and also i feel so much shame. Moreover, i feel guilty for trying to be with someone else , even though we had been broken up for 7 months and we continued to be broken up months after. He makes me feel like a wh*re for doing so and he follows that boy on social media, telling me where he works and everything, when i have no connection to him. I don’t even follow him.

What did I really do to deserve that? Nothing. They try their hardest to make you doubt yourself and believe that you deserve that reaction and the things they call you but you dont and you never will.

4353,"He cheated on me, but then chose to leave instead of fight.","I was in a relationship with my boyfriend for 2.5 years, and we’ve always been quite rocky. I’ve always felt that he has always wanted attention from other women, besides me. He enjoys going to bars and drinking and making new friends there, mostly female friends. He would sometimes take me to these same bars, but to others he wouldn’t. 

One Wednesday (a working night), he went and had drinks at his neighbourhood bar he usually goes to. We weren’t texting the whole night, as usually when we are busy we don’t text eachother 24/7. I didn’t think much of it of him not responding as it’s usually because he’s exhausted after work and sleeps early

I’ve had the logins to his Instagram and Facebook for months, and have been checking on them periodically.. I know this is not right. But I always felt insecure and when I felt he wasn’t able to give me reassurance, I would check his accounts to make sure nothing fishy is going on. 

That’s when I saw the text. A (much older woman) messaged him saying she had his hat. He asked to come by and pick it up, and mentioned in the messages that he “is seeing someone and that shouldn’t have happened that night”

My heart sank. I confronted him and he told me he kissed a girl as they went back to her place, but he was blacked out. I messaged her, she said some nakedness happened but “once things started progressing he randomly put on all his clothes and left very quickly.”

After confronting him, he turned it on me and told me how I am completely nefarious for going through his things for months. And he mentioned how he didn’t have plans to tell me about his “stupid drunk mistake”. He says how what I did sober was a lot worse than what he did while he was drunk. 

I’ve been trying for 6 weeks now to try to work though things and to talk about it, but he refuses to have a conversation. And says how he will never be able to forgive me for what I’ve done. I’ve been screamed at, thrown out of the house, and threatened because “I won’t move on and get over it”. Am I being abused or manipulated?

4355,Do you ever wonder how you ended up here?,"I mean, I’m relatively well educated, worked and was financially independent and capable before we got married. 

Our very gender typical relationship arrangements (me doing all the housework) seemed logical at first cause he worked longer hours than me. Then we had children and it divided even more. 

I feel like I’ve been asleep for 8 years and am somehow only now sticking my head above ground to realise I’m living in the 1950’s. I cook, clean and  work to please him and if his day didn’t go well, he gets to take it out on me whilst I shush the kids to save them from being in the firing line of his mood. 

I’ve lived off next to nothing whilst he (granted) paid the bills but then had plenty of disposable income to spend on himself and his hobbies whilst I walked around in threadbare clothes and shoes with holes in the sole. All whilst being expected to stay attractive to him and keep the house and children. 

I don’t know how I didn’t spot it. Why I didn’t stand up for myself earlier on? Why the first tome he told my family I was fat and grumpy I didn’t tell him to get out.

4362,Do you guys still have nightmares about your ex years after you’ve gotten yourself out of the relationship?,"A while back I made a post in here about my struggles since getting out of my relationship with my controlling and emotionally abusive ex. I am now with a new guy (celebrated our 1 year in June!) who treats me so well. He’s so kind and understanding of me, and most importantly he lets me have my freedom and just be myself. I’m not chained to him like I was with my ex. I can go out with my friends without him worrying I’m going to cheat on him. I can wear low cut shirts or tight clothing when I go out, or even harmless things like sports bras to the gym without him telling me it’s inappropriate and he doesn’t want other guys looking at me. I can sleep at home or spend some time away from him without him telling me I don’t love him. I can sleep peacefully through the night without him going through my phone then gaslighting me when I catch him in the act. I can talk to my guy friends and give them hugs without being told I’m giving them the wrong impression. I can refuse sex because I’m not in the mood without him forcing himself on me. I can live my own life. Finally. 

I feel so free and it’s amazing. I really really hope you all can feel this way as well. It took me a long ass time to get to this point, but I have my confidence back and feel like my old upbeat, optimistic, social and independent self again. 

However, very rarely I will have dreams where I am in a social setting with my college friends (graduated in 2018). Well all be chilling together at my school, and then I happen to run into my ex. The site of him terrifies me and when he sees me and tries to come up to me, all I do is run away as fast as I can. It’s pretty unsettling and the worst part for me honestly is just seeing his face again in my dream. It’s pretty freaky. Does this happen to you guys as well?

4363,Hit With Depression 18 Months Post Breakup -Is This Normal?,"In June 2022, I (30F) finally left a 7ish year relationship which encompassed every conceivable form of abuse; verbal (almost daily name-calling), sexual (sex against my will, also on an almost daily basis), financial (he didn't work but spent my money happily), physical (frequent strangulation, being pinned, slapped, dragged by the hair, having my clothes ripped from my body, attempted waterboarding, having a knife held to my throat etc), coercive control (him going through my phone and laptop, secretly recording me and blackmailing me with them etc). We lived together in a different country to where we grew up, so I was largely isolated from any possible support network. In the end, after years of research and planning, I made it out.

For the first few months, I felt a lot of rage and wanted him to suffer the way he made me suffer. This was followed by over a year of elation. There have been bad days, sure, but on the whole I have felt profoundly grateful for my freedom having been so intensely controlled for so many years, have enjoyed eating what I want, going out when I want, going to sleep when I'm tired, watching whatever movies I like etc. Everyone close to me has remarked on how incredibly well I have been doing given the circumstances, so I guess I wasn't expecting the depression which hit me around the beginning of December.

I feel so low in myself more often than not. I have almost zero motivation to do anything on the days that I am not working (not even get out of bed, shower, do laundry, take a walk etc), and I now dread leaving the office each day and being alone again. I'm OK when socializing (which is infrequently, as I don't have many friends) and WAS managing OK at work, though the last week or so, I have found that my low mood plagues me even in the office and today I cried at my desk. I am in trauma therapy but don't find that those sessions are enormously helpful -I have an acute self awareness and understanding of my triggers etc, so there haven't been any eureka moments. In short, I have zero identity outside of work and am merely existing from day to day, though would prefer not to go the medication route as I am concerned it will prevent from processing the pain that I need to process.

Have any fellow DV survivors been hit with a depressive episode so long after the break up, and after an initially positive reaction? How long did it last? And what helped?

4365,Reproductive/Vaginal Trauma,"I was in an extremely violent relationship for almost a decade which included among other things financial control (despite the fact I worked), horrendous emotional/verbal abuse, reproductive coercion, horrible physical violence, and sexual violence. 
I got out a few years ago… started seeing a therapist/psychiatrist, met a wonderful man and remarried… I was having horrible pelvic pain and I had vaginal scar tissue that kept breaking open. I couldn’t have sex but that didn’t seem to bother him-he knew the things I’d gone through. He finally talked me into seeing a specialist. 

I had lichen sclerosis from trauma (which is why my scarring was ulcerating), vaginismus, a retroflexed uterus, adhesions, scaring, endometriosis, and polycystic ovaries (I had known about the PCOS for years but never had a previous diagnosis of the rest.) I had a hysterectomy/scar tissue removal sometime ago… it helped a lot. But they couldn’t take the ovaries as they are “stuck” to the abdomen wall. So I still get cysts/pain from cysts.

I started seeing a pelvic floor physiotherapist and have made progress for the frozen up muscles (vaginismus) and I had the lichens in remission.

However, about 3 days ago I had a lichen relapse and I am in so much pain especially when trying to empty my bladder. I’ve started steroids back and a powerful topical lidocaine but even then, I can’t stand my clothes touching me, weeping, I want to scream just from moving wrong… and I’m terrified to go to the restroom. After notifying my doctor of the flare, she basically informed me if I keep being unable to empty my bladder-I’ll have to have a temporary catheter placed.

My point for this entire post… I’m angry, I’m sad, and I’m in so much pain that it’s causing crazy depression… I had come to terms with losing my fertility and I was making so much progress physically. I was even making wonderful progress in regards to my mental health. And then this happened.

Has anyone out there dealt with lichen sclerosis from sexual trauma? How did you handle the physical symptoms? How did you manage the emotional fallout and the bad days?

4381,"He (m34) was arrested, but is still manipulating me (f25)","For context: my ex and I were together for 6 years, and he lived with me and was on the lease for our apartment for most of that time. Most of the abuse was emotional, calling me names, isolating me etc..  But he also threatened to kill me a few times, left me with bruises and choked me many times. It wasn’t until he hurt me only a couple weeks after causing me to need stitches that I was brave enough to report him to the police and get a restraining order. 

The second he made bail, he had someone drive to the apartment and collect some toiletries and a small basket of clothes. It’s been 5 months since then, and all of his things are still here. He dropped off his key with the police and stopped paying rent after the arrest, but the house is full of his furniture, almost his entire wardrobe, his important documents, his valuables and keepsakes…. Literally everything. I’ve spoken to his attorney to see if he could help but so far nothing has happened since we talked. And after getting a taste of what talking to his attorney is like, I’m terrified of what the trial will be like. 

I feel trapped having panic attacks in this apartment filled with reminders of my ex and what is coming. I can’t afford to move out, because I’m living paycheck to paycheck, just to pay the rent.

4385,She didn’t deserve this,"Hello everybody. I’m new to the group and have personally never been in a domestic violence situation, but just lost my best friend to one and I NEED to do anything I can to prevent the next one.

My friend was such a good person. She had 0 hate in her heart for ANYBODY. Her kids father beat her, cheated on her and disrespected her for years, and no matter how many people told her to leave him she gave him so many chances. All she wanted was for her kids to be able to see their mommy and daddy happy together. 

The most recent time he beat her she finally had enough. She went and filed an OP against him and took the kids and left. She had never done this any of the years before, she finally reached her breaking point and knew she had enough. A few days later she went home to grab more clothes and he was waiting there for her, and shot and killed her. Her life taken by the person she loved the most.

My heart is destroyed knowing her two babies will never get to see their mommy again. Knowing there were so many signs and this could’ve been prevented. Wishing I would’ve just tried to get through to her one last time. Now she’s gone from this world forever and NOTHING I do or say will ever bring her back or make it right and thats a different type of hurt. 

Im telling yall this to say, ladies if you have an abusive partner please run. Please love and save yourself before it is too late. We HAVE to keep informing people to see the signs.

I vigorously went back into my old routines, went out to my old spots, reconnected with a couple of old friends that I had been isolated from, but everywhere I go it feels like people see me differently now, I don’t feel the same in fact, I feel like some lower life form, a maggot to be honest, and I feel like I’m now seen as such. 

I don’t know if he’s beaten me so low or if it’s just self pity, or the underlying issues that could only be addressed through therapy and psychology, but I don’t feel normal at all and it’s been eating away the last bit of hope I have left for myself.

They talked to him all the phone and he said he was going to his mom's in Long Beach. Stayed in the apartment and grabbed some things and came up to my car but I'm hearing banging like if things are being moved outside of the garage. Its an apartment complex so it could just be a neighbor. But he could've come back and be throwing all my stuff in the dumpster. I can't hear anybody talking so I can't determine who it is. Should I open the garage and find out or should I stay hiding in here? If it's him he knows I'm in the garage so I'm kind of stuck and he could open the garage any second and come in here. Maybe if I'm the one to open the garage I'll have an element of surprise and be able to get away?

UPDATE: I got out of there with the help of a neighbor. He did show up and he was banging things around but I guess he was just getting a change of clothes or something. 

I was able to sneak off and came by the apartment after to see if all my stuff was gone. Thankfully it wasn't and I was able to pack everything quickly and I took it to a storage unit. I spent all the money I had on the unit though it was the smallest unit they had but it was also all my money . He made sure to get most of my money before all this even happened . 

Right now I'm sleeping in my car I don't want to risk going back to that apartment again. I just got to figure out where I'm going to go now and what I'm going to do. I don't have anybody I can turn to for help or even to let me just stay a couple nights. He scared any friends I had away a long time ago. I don't got family I can turn to. 

But at least I'm safe. For now. I don't plan on going back to him. I've taken him back so many times before. He's got about 30 different charges for DV on me. He's got trial in 3 days and it really doesn't look good for him at all. He's fully not going to be a problem anymore soon.

Thank you too everyone who showed concern. I really appreciate that. I know that none of you know me but but he has me thinking that nobody would give a damn my body got found somewhere.

I’m just trying to keep my clarity strong and gain as much insight as possible during this separation.

I then moved out and we have a no contact order in place. 

In that same night, before the anger started, he was kissing me on the couch fully clothed and he grabbed me by the neck and pinned me down like that for about 3 seconds. I don’t really like that and something about it really scared me because I could sense some low level agitation starting in him. It confuses me because we weren’t arguing yet, but it  seemed like he wanted to see how much he could “dominate” me. And then slowly over the next hour he began to pick a fight with me that made me feel like grabbing my neck earlier was fueled by some level of rage deep down. 

I’m really struggling with whether or not to take the hands on the neck as a threat because it was in some sexual context. I can’t remember if he thinks I like that or not but I don’t….I feel like all the lines are blurred and don’t know if I’m over reacting by the shortness of time he held me like that.

About a month in, he started to make me feel like I’m going crazy. He would “play fight” by biting me, pinching me,  and grabbing onto me hard. This led me to have lots of bruises and some cuts. But he did it jokingly not out of anger. So I thought I just bruised easily and am being dramatic. (Still feel that way) 

he also made comments that confused me. I glared at him as a joke and he told me he would slap me on the face the next time I did that. Asked me before I went home for my moms wedding (in college) what I would tell them if they asked about the bruises. 

The past couple of days, he has said really cruel things to me. “Your a sped, I’m better looking (not true trust me lol), you have a big forehead, your sun damage makes you look 35 (I’m 19), and the list goes on and on. Weirdly majority are just not true and that’s why I feel like maybe I shouldn’t be THAT upset. It’s just hard to hear constant insults all the time. 

Truthfully, I’m a wreck from all of this and I’ve only known him for a little under 3 months.

I worked very hard & landed in an Ivy League undergraduate school, but couldn’t finish because when my mom lost her job & my dad lost his job. I was working three jobs, and trying to take a lot of credits to finish early, and dealing with my own bleeding colon and lack of access to meds. I’d eat one meal a day if I could afford it. My mom was committed for stroke risk because she was worried I would leave him. My parents said they would be unable to be taken care if I leave him.  They had health issues and I had to step in as the oldest daughter. I had health issues then, and developed a severe-disability. I’m now a disabled adult, but despite of that was having success in my startup. Then my abusive partner sabotaged all my opportunities cause I think he fears me being financially independent.  My parents rely on him, my dad is elderly. I have nothing but what he gave me - I’m on his health insurance, he gets me my meds, all the clothes, & electronics. But, it comes at a cost - I get concussed,  or verbally abused, sleep deprived, attacked.  My time is taken. I’m terrified of him. He bought a 1.3M house, his parents have $40M, he never put me on the deed. He’s terrifying and powerful. He said he could ruin me. I have no income. I have struggled with one meal a day (if that) before and the foods I could afford triggered my bleeds in my colon.

4404,Don’t know what to do,"He says he just lashed out, but that I pushed him to do it. I had a bad feeling when I was heading to the airport. His sister was supposed to talk to him about the state of things. I had called her the previous week to talk more about his depression, his tendencies and his past. I don’t know if she did or not, and if so, what she said. But the fact that one of the first things he said to me was calling me a “stupid c@&$”, I knew things weren’t going well. He also said “sometimes I want to bash your skull in”. Our three-year-old son was awake in the backseat for that as well. I didn’t know what to do once we got home. I didn’t go inside initially. I tried texting his sister. But she was on her honeymoon, so I wasn’t surprised to get no response.

I went in holding our son. He kept telling me to get out of his sight as I watched him unpack. I told him the things he said scared me. That I don’t feel safe, that I wanted reassurance that he’s not going to kill me. He wouldn’t give me that and just told me to get out of his sight. Feeling very threatened by this I started to try to leave with our son. He said he would report me for kidnapping. He implied he would get our son taken away from me, that I’m a neglectful mother. He came at me while I was holding our son, putting his hand around my throat, knocking all of us to the ground. I immediately started scratching at him, and I promised I wouldn’t leave. He stopped and pretty much insisted I hand over our son. He insisted that he would never hurt him, and that if I feel uncomfortable or scared, I should leave and leave our son with him. Things calmed down slightly, and he let me take our son up to bed. And that’s where I am right now. Afraid to go to sleep in my own home.



Things are far from resolved. But I’m so grateful for all the support I’ve received and feel so fortunate to have the resources to at least afford a hotel for a few days.",yes,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred
4405,The purge,"Two night ago my now ex-boyfriend knocked me off my feet, bent over and choked me, then started punching me in the face leaving me with multiple bruises, splitting my lip and knocking out my front tooth. He left right after so when the cops came he wasn’t around. This was the final straw. 

My mom flew out, we are in the process of getting a restraining order in place and the detective is working on getting a warrant for his arrest. 

He laid low for a few days but last night and this morning he keeps calling over and over and texting over and over. He has been sleeping in his car without a change of clothes and he is trying to come back to my house (I own the home solo) to use the shower and want to talk to me. 

I am holding strong and not allowing it, no answering his calls, keeping it short and brief with a text message saying he can come by in a 30min window to pick up his stuff outside on the sidewalk. The police will be here at that time. We just finished packing his stuff into trash bags. 

Holding strong. This is so hard. I loved him with all my heart. He permanently disfigured me.  I’m holding strong.

4407,What do I need to leave?,"This is my second time posting from this throwaway account. I don’t want these posts to come back on me later so I don’t post them from my true Reddit account. I posted last week about my relationship, and invite you to read that to get some context. 

I’m unsure if I’m posting this in the right place, because he doesn’t hit me, and I don’t mean to undermine domestic violence victims, so I will apologize in advance if I mistakenly posted in the wrong place. 

Basically, he’s been hiding my things from me to keep me from leaving but walks us into arguments that 1) make me want to leave and 2) when I do leave for a day or so to avoid others hearing us argue, he uses that against me later and questions my commitment. It’s all a mental game that he plays. 

I FINALLY found my other car key (he hid it 6 weeks ago). What ignited me to find it was when he put my other key in the washer with the sheets (I have been sleeping with my key under the pillow so he can’t take it in the middle of the night without waking me up) the key that he washed is fried and if I didn’t find the other I would be trapped. 

I plan on working through the rest of the week and the weekend and departing for good Monday afternoon. Yes, we can keep the peace until then. I need the time here to make sure I have all my belongings out of the house and to create a coherent plan that allows me to leave without EVER having the urge to come back or answer his calls once I’m gone. He has a history of baiting me into coming back. 

I guess what I’d like to know is, other than having as much cash as I can possibly gather, what else should I do before I go? I’ll have my clothes & important documents. Changing my phone number isn’t an option. But I’ll gladly block him. 

Is there anything else I should have in order? Are there some goals I can set to make sure I avoid him for good? Is there any advice anybody could give me?

4414,I finally did it,"I left him. This morning. After yet another emotional degrading episode in front of our 5 kids I took it as a sign to get out. I was not at all prepared because I’ve been so afraid, but when he went to work -after leaving and coming back multiple times- I threw clothes for me and my kids into a hamper took some snacks and a few essential items and documents and we left. Of course he’s promising he’s getting help. He’s crying he misses his kids. Trying all the things he can to get me to give into his control. But my sister helped me and I have safe place to sleep with my kids until Tuesday. And hopefully I will hear back from my local DV assistance/shelter. They have a long waitlist so I couldn’t get into it right away. I am afraid I will get arrested for taking my kids without his permission and he dosent know where they are. I’m afraid I will let him reel me back in. I’m afraid I really won’t be able to take care of myself and my kids like he’s told me countless times in the past. But I decided I can’t let the fear I have stop me. I have also contacted my local legal aid and submitted an online application so hopefully they can get back to me ASAP. I have so many thoughts spiraling threw my head as I lay with my sleeping children. If anyone has any advice on what I should/could do please tell me.

4416,Is it really abuse or am I exaggerating/going crazy?,"So my (28F) spouse (37M) of 6 years has been verbally abusive and psychologically abusive. I’m sure about that. 

He’s also done a lot of non-consensual things during sex, though I have always been afraid to stop him or push him away because of how angry he gets. So also sexually abusive. 

We’ve done couples therapy three times now (more harm than help) and he has been going to therapy alone but things have gotten worse since then. The therapist tells me that my spouse does realize after-the-fact that he was wrong and knows he needs to change, and to be patient because change doesn’t happen overnight. 

However, things have gotten so much worse than before. Apart from yelling and swearing and belittling me he also has started throwing things; first socks, then clothes, then wet dish rags, and then tonight he threw his phone at a box of diapers as hard as he could and then began throwing the couch pillows at me - at head and stomach, close range and as hard as he could. A few years ago he broke our dining room table because he was upset about a soccer game but I never thought that would translate into violence towards me. He recently has been telling me that I need to see a psychiatrist because I’m obviously sick.

I’ve wanted to leave for a while but I never know where to go. Recently I decided I better just go to a shelter, but I’m afraid they’ll reject me because I haven’t been hit, and I’m also afraid if I leave he’ll get custody (of our two toddlers) because I don’t have physical evidence of any abuse (apart from my own records), have never filed police reports, and he is great at manipulating people. 

I just don’t feel like I’ll be taken seriously anywhere, but im afraid it will escalate even more. I can’t trust him and never know what will be next. This is like the last straw for me. But is that logical? Am I wrong to think that throwing things(even though they’re soft) is abuse?

4420,Finding power after you leave?,"Sorry this is gonna ramble.  I just left my husband who strangled me, threatened to kill me and went to jail etc.  It wasn’t my first time being assaulted.  He assaulted me twice before, previous partners have pushed me and such, I’ve been mugged and hit with a crow bar, and I’ve been the victim of a particularly nasty incident of road rage. I don’t really have a lot of anger about any of these incidents and I still speak to my husband (I know it’s dangerous but I moved cities so I feel like I can).  I’ve been suicidal for much of my life and when these things happened to me, I felt resigned to the violence of them.  I almost feel as if these things are okay because of the violence I’ve done to myself in the past.  It’s not like I’m on drugs or anything weird.  I’m studious and I don’t break laws.  I just seem to get into these situations and I let people hurt me.
Anyway, I want to change.  It sounds silly, but I was watching this tarantino revenge flick, deathproof, and something clicked.  These women in the film go after there terrorizer and they get him back.  I want to be like that.  I don’t want to call him anymore or play nice.  He almost killed me.  I want to be a badass and protect myself.  How do you go about this type of change?  Any ideas?  Should I get self defense weapons, change my clothes, call him out on social media?

There, I said it.
I’ve been too embarrassed to say it out loud because I know if I did, it is real.
And if my neighbors didn’t call the cops on my husband yesterday, I would not even realize that I am a victim.
I went to the hospital, my 3yr old in tow, to have myself checked. While waiting for my name to be called, an unfamiliar phone # popped up on my screen. I answered it and the operator said I have a phone call from my husband, who’s in jail, and if I like to take his call. I did. He’s begging me to bail him out. I said I have no money and to call his family. Whom none called and checked in on us if me and my son were okay. (My husband called his father while he was verbally abusing me.) His brother bailed him out but couldn’t pick him up. I know I should not have but picked him up from the police station so he can pack his clothes to stay with his parents. He had the audacity to tell me that I didn’t even sound sorry that he was in jail and that his parents are mad at me for sending him to jail. First and foremost, I was not there when the cops came. I was at hospital. I did not press any charges. I should have considering the many times he’s hurt me.
I am done packing my son’s clothes and donated his toys. I have started packing mine. This would be my first time driving for 6hrs so wish me luck. I wish I can bring everything with me because it’s so hard to start all over again from scratch. But my mother said those are just material things that can be replaced.

4425,feeling helpless after an abusive relationship,"hi everyone, i recently got out of an abusive relationship. a bit of context: a few years ago, i was young, only just starting uni, quite naive, living in a different country, coming from an extremely strict and conservative family. unfortunately, i made some mistakes (got too drunk, hooked up with people) but nothing that REALLY deeply hurt anyone, yk? typical just-starting-out-uni-student stuff if i may say so myself. after the first year of uni, i started to get better in terms of all that stuff and i started dating this amazing (or so i thought) guy. we were dating for 6 months before everything started going downhill. suddenly, he started calling me words like sl\*t, saying stuff like ""why did you do that?"" ""no one will ever want you now"" etc etc. he also asked for SO much detail, it felt extremely violating - asking stuff like ""what exactly did you do? did you take off your clothes"" etc. and he started accusing me of cheating (which i never did) and just saying I only tell him half truths instead of the whole truth if i didn't want to relive that part of my life. he also told me things like my parents will never love me

even though i am out of this relationship, he still haunts me - suddenly i feel like i am disgusting, and just dont deserve anything and i shouldn't be alive and i feel like ive been sucked back into that hole and i have been feeling like i will never be able to escape my past. i dont know what to do i dont know how to feel better and i dont know how to move on. i feel like it is too late and i've already ruined my life.",irrelevant,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4427,Do any of you not hate your abuser?,"4 months ago, I took our children (4 y/o and 7 months) in the middle of the night with a bag full of diapers and clothes, got a DVPO and filed for divorce. I’ve been friends with my husband for 20 years, married for 4 years.  He is incredibly intelligent, funny, spontaneous, passionate and loyal.  But, of course, he was abusive to me and our dog and had horrific fits of rage, was sexually assaultive and was extremely controlling. Towards the end, I realized that both our dog and I started shaking whenever we saw him or heard him coming around.  

Since we left, he has broken the DVPO numerous times and been arrested for it twice; but he hasn’t really been threatening to me. He sends me videos of him sobbing, pleading, begging for me to come back and that he loves us more than life itself. It’s been so incredibly painful for me to watch the father of my children and a friend for over half my life be in so much emotional pain.

His father was horrifically violent to his mom, his sister and him growing up.  He hated his dad and vowed to never be like him.  I think that because he was never as physically violent with me (but he was with our dog) that he thought he was doing a good job.

I can’t get over the guilt of causing him so much pain. I can’t hate him. I haven’t got anger towards him most days.

I went to work, came home, cooked and then off to my sons baseball game. Came home late and I was tired but found the energy to do at least one load so he can have clothes as he’s a plumber. I was exhausted by the time I plopped into bed. This morning I made a simple breakfast. He was okay until he went to fill his water bottle with ice from the freezer. He was having a difficult time because of the food that was in there and dropped some stuff. He then proceeds to yell at me because I didn’t make the breakfast earlier and the food was in his way in the freezer. How horrible of me to have food for my family! I was sitting eating trying to ignore him when he went up to me and smacked the plate out of my hands. All of this in front of the kids. I can’t take it and don’t know what to do. I don’t have any family or anyone who supports me. When I’ve tried to reach out to someone, I’m told I’m stupid and belittled by those I’ve reach out to.

4434,My abuser didn’t take the plea bargain,"Trigger warning and Rant:

The ADA presented my abuser with his plea deal. Two years probation and a batters course with a alcohol and drug assessment. He isn’t wanting to accept it and is wanting to take it to the grand jury. You know why? He claims that what he did was consensual. Because we enjoyed rough sex in the past, that what he did was okay. 
We had broken up the day before. He was so intoxicated he couldn’t stand up straight. He threatened me with a gun, slapped me, ripped my clothes off to take nude photos of me, sent those photos to someone else, and then tried to strangle me. What part of any of that is consensual??? I realize that he is trying to come up with some excuse but no matter what we did in the past, once I say no, that means no. I was so shocked that he decided to use that as an excuse. 
Part of me wants it to go to the preliminary hearing so I can tell my side and tell the judge that as soon as I said no and to leave me alone, he should have but chose not to.

4435,Trying to leave my abuser once and for all.,"My ex boyfriend has been physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive for 8-9 months of our relationship. At first i saw all the red flags. The excessive projection, blaming me and everyone around him for his circumstances. Love bombing me and idealizing me then devaluing me. Trying to control me and when he realized he couldn’t he would project, say I was cheating on him, a liar, my boundaries made me suspicious, untrustworthy and toxic. He would call me delusional, mental, crazy, worthless and a horrible human if he felt he was being abandoned or rejected by me. I couldn’t hang out with any of my friends. He saw them all as a threat. If anyone flirted with me he would lash out on me and say I was doing it for attention. If I wore clothing too revealing he’d say I was asking for it. 


He wanted me to only depend on him. Once I did and became codependent, he said I was smothering him. He felt trapped and like he couldn’t do anything with his life. He started to become shady and speaking to other women trying to find a way out of the relationship. I confronted him about it but he would call me paranoid, delusional and obsessed.

Whenever he was angry he would say hurtful things. Gaslight me and deny everything and anything. He would take my phone as a means of control and when I took his back out of retaliation cause I was tired of him treating me that way, it gave him an excuse to punch me. That’s when the hitting started. Whenever I lashed back out of defense for myself he would slam my head against the wall, watch me crumble and cry to myself.

4439,Update. Doing much better after abuser is gone.,"Hi. I've been posting here for a while about my abusive relationship. It's now been one month since my abusive bf has moved out to his mother's and you know what? I simply do not miss or love him anymore.  We lived together for over a year so I'm surprised that I'm feeling better. When he first moved out I never ever thought I would feel this good. The first 2 weeks were the WORST and I even begged him back the first night.  I felt like I was dying at first. I thought I would be miserable without him. I haven't cried at all for over a week. I haven't been feeling sad. I have not been missing him. Every day I've been waking up and celebrating that he is gone. I can go out when I want, stay out late, wear what I want, not be abused, and I can actually have friends. We've been having parties here. I can actually get my hair done and buy clothes without explaining myself to him. He didn't like me spending my own money on myself, even though he would do that at the expense of us going without food at times. I'm able to do these things AND pay rent/ buy enough food as I don't have to fund him anymore. He told me I need to go live with my toxic family to be able to survive without him and he even messaged them without my consent when he left, but I have not needed to at all. I'm still living by myself and managing just fine. It was him who needed to live with people to manage. This is how much he drained me. My cat is loving not being around DV as when I would scream in fear she would get scared. I had a cuddle with a cute guy with big muscles last weekend. I feel so much better mentally. Not because of a guy but because I feel free. I'm not even on medication yet. I think this is just me getting further into my detox from him. Ex has been blocked for weeks. I will still deal with what has happened and I do have a dv counsellor appointment this week which will continue with the same lady. I know I have a lot of trauma which I do struggle with and I will make sure it gets attention.

4445,My husband says that I hit him first...,"During an argument he started shouting at me less than an inch close to my face (he’s done this a few times before) so as he was screaming whatever he was screaming at me I was screaming to back up away from me and he refused to. I started to try to push him back a bit and he started punching me in the chest &amp; screaming for me to hit him so he can hit me back. When I tell him I feel like im being abused by my husband (I didn’t say I AM being abused i said i feel like I’m being abused) he laughed at me and said im just playing the victim &amp; that he only hit me cause I hit him first. I feel like there’s no talking to him. I don’t know what to do I feel like im not strong enough to just break things off on my own. He really doesn’t feel like he’s abusing me or being abusive at all and that I’m just this huge b***h that nags at him for no reason &amp; he “matches my energy”

Also during the same argument I got upset &amp; lashed out on our room (I threw some clothes on the floor &amp; made a mess but didn’t break anything or hurt/touch him at all” and he screamed “LOOK WHAT YOU DID TO OUR ROOM” &amp; grabbed me by my hair and made me look around at the mess. But I’m not being abused, right?

For the record, this whole argument started because I was falling asleep &amp; he wanted me to put something on the tv to watch. I told him “I’m tired, if you wanna watch something then feel free to put something on” and he got mad &amp; said he puts something to watch on EVERY DAY (not true) but it kinda just went from there. To me, this is such a stupid thing to argue about &amp; I’d never expect someone to choose something to watch knowing they’re not going to watch it, and fall asleep. Also, there is no reason this argument should have escalated the way it did.

Claims they never really cared about AP.  Well, AP made NS feel some type of way to make them decide to continue the affair for another 4 months after I told NS to stop and they agreed to stop and said they had.  

Lots of emotions and insecurities to say the least so I wrote out a note to AP yesterday and brought it to NS attention…they said do what I have to do to feel better…so I added just a bit more…read it out to NS and sent it…AP lies and denies.  

I slept on it and decided this morning that OBS needs to be made aware.  Let NS know what my plan was and again…they said do what I have to do, but did remind me of consequences of my actions...with not knowing how OBS might react.  

I feel a ton of weight lifted (



OBS is an addict and I am “crazy” with mental health issues of my own…serving our nation comes with consequences. 🙄  Of course it’s my fault for being “crazy” and OBS for being an addict…yes, we are so bad we deserve to be cheated on. 🤔


Edit #2:  The following is what I came up with and sent to AP…I was pissed and that’s why the immaturity and passive aggressiveness.

AP, My Love.  
It was you and your long black hair that WS loves so much that allowed me to know that you continued the affair with WS!  Oh, wait. WS didn’t tell you I told WS  to end the both of you in October?  I can never thank you enough for your disgusting habit.  At least that is what WS thought when I had long black hair.  It was our child who showed me on child’s own that you and WS were still in a relationship.  Just like you have chosen to be a homewrecker, I too can ruin your life.  Please stop all communication with WS outside of work.  I suggest you stop the relationship or don’t…WS will be yours.

PS, WS is not to be trusted.  I KNOW EVERYTHING about you.  Your mother in law situation, OBS and their drug addiction, your daughter’s school, your kids are cute.  Even that fat little AP look alike.  Have a lovely life.",yes,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred
4468,Should I give him another chance?,"
I (20 F) and my now ex boyfriend (33 M) have had a very interesting two months. In the beginning, he was incredible towards me, promises, love, affection, the whole 9 yards. In the beginning of this month he picked up extra shifts at work and he has been unbearable ever since. He’s controlling my clothing, my social circle, the way I talk and act. He’s been throwing tantrums and expects me to act calm and help him get over whatever is annoying him instead of reacting. He’s jealous of absolutely every male that enters my life, doesn’t matter if I’ve known them for years or met them right then and there, they’re an issue. He’s been bugging me about sharing my location with him, for “security reasons”. My psychologist claims he’s showing signs of narcissistic personality disorder and he could potentially be very dangerous. I broke up with him not too long ago and the breakup was tragic, he was constantly fluctuating between saying he loves and cares about me, and threatening to expose my actions to our coworkers. I have since moved in a different city because of university and he’s been constantly trying to get me back. I miss the man I fell for, but I’m not sure if it’s wise to give him the benefit of the doubt. Is he really just tired from work and lashing out? Or is that an excuse?

Update: he has been constantly trying to get back in contact with me ever since I left, I made the mistake to pick up his call last night and he made me feel terrible about my decision, saying I don’t know how to love and I’m easily influenced by my peers. I have since sent him a text that reads:

“I thought about what we said last night and I came to the conclusion that I can’t be with you. This is the last text I’m sending and I’m asking you to not try to contact me further, I’ll have to block you if you do. I trust that you’ll respect my decision. 
Have a good life, goodbye.”

He has expressed multiple times the desire to come visit me “just to give me a hug and apologise for what he did”, I asked him not to but I’m scared he will. I will be talking with a friend that works with him so I’ll be notified if he quits early or expresses the desire to fly over to me. Thank you all for your replies, you really startled me and I came to my senses. He’s been bombarding me with calls and texts but I will not cave again. I hope this is the last update and things stop.

4487,Saw New Person," I'd already known about them but it was still so painful to watch. Someone was giving me a ride and chose to take his street. I didn't say anything because...well it's been a year and a month. I have to find a way to not let triggers get to me anymore, right? 

But man, the universe has been really testing me lately. Had we been driving there literally ten seconds earlier/later, I wouldn't have witnessed it. It hurt so much. It made me imagine what kind of a weekend they had, sex in his bedroom, wine, brunch. She used to be me, and for some reason I keep thinking he's more attentive/respectful to her. And the dude driving me was making small talk, asking if I like Metallica. I felt like I was being choked, and just waiting to be home so I could burst into tears, the same way one needs to be home IMMEDIATELY when they need to use the bathroom and the driver is choosing to drive slowly. 

Will there ever be a day when I don't care? We've been mostly no contact except a year ago so I could get closure (you can imagine how THAT backfired...ended up having sex and calling me an Uber as soon as my clothes were back on). And in September, I wanted to see where he's at and if there was a chance for reconciliation (I was too late. He was already seeing her). 

This especially sucks because I am working so hard to see myself as worthy of serious partnership. It really didn't help.

4492,Horror,"I thought being married to him was bad. My post history has some details for those curious enough to read. I have never felt such fear and devastation. His abuse has skyrocketed since I told him on 2/9 I was filing for divorce. He knows our child is the absolute light of my life (there is no question that I love our baby more than I could have ever loved my husband). When I escaped our home with the baby, I couldn’t force myself to go back a few days later when I said I would. He took that as me abducting the baby, and has now filed for emergency temporary custody on the basis of my lack of fitness as a parent. We were able to work out a temporary parenting schedule until the hearing. I was to pack the baby up and put him in the car with my sister in law at 2:30, and at 6:00 I would pick the baby up at her apartment. As soon as she drove away with the baby, I was served. The papers were just a lesson on fantasy writing, with details of how he is the responsible, devoted father and how I am a recovering drug addict with mental illness. After reading this and seeing that he was filing for sole custody with supervised visitation, more of the picture came clear. I went to our apartment with my sister and brother in law, and collected some items I needed (clothes, shoes, school books, baby clothes, toys…) I go to his sister’s building. 6:00, 6:15, 6:30…. I stepped out of the building and was barred reentry by the doorman, who informed me that my husband was “coming shortly, and I should wait outside”. When he eventually came down, there was no baby. He informed me he would not be returning the baby based on my “aggressive tone” and my “ransacking the apartment”. 
I clearly can’t say everything here, but he stole my baby from me that night. For the first time in 17 months, I was away from the creature who lived inside of me. The child that I feed from my body and love with every ounce of my being. There is nothing that he could say or do that would hurt me more than this.",yes,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4493,"The ""good"" phase of the relationship commences"," 

We are now in the good phase of our interactions. I continue to yellow rock right now and its easy, since I'm working so much. I have been able to keep our interactions minimum at home since I am so busy with deadlines. 

I learned from the book ""Stop caretaking the borderline or narcissist"" that this is the mystification phase. Previously, I'd deny and try to forget the blow ups and temper outbursts. Now, I see what is happening, but I am mystified by the change. His good behavior is incongruent with the bad and its so confusing. But my confusion is a good thing, because it means I am no not longer in denial. Nor do I want to go back. Baby steps. 

Since I have so much work, housework has fallen to the wayside for the last 2 weeks. Without asking, he folded and put away 3 loads of clean clothes and washed our child's clothes as well. This stands out because 1.) I don't do laundry for the narcissist, so these were household or child's clothes. 2.) last week when I asked him to fold child's clothes, because I was behind and desperately needed the help, he had a temper tantrum slamming doors and stomping around. Even child noticed it the tantrum last week. Narcissist didn't fold my clothes, but I figured out that I can't ask him for help. I have to to just let whatever it is go, then he can make the choice of his own volition (If it bothers him of course). This is truly mystifying. He doesn't want his partner to ask him for things, but he'll just do it if he wants to. 

The same can be said for driving our child to activities. Instead me asking ""Can you drive \[child\] to \[activity\],"" I just said ""\[Child\] is not going to \[activity\], because I can't take him."" At that point, I get an ""I can do it.  from narcissist. Then I respond with an ""It's up to you if you have time.""

How utterly ridiculous. Honestly though, I'm treating these situations as how would I behave if he wasn't here.  I'd let the laundry sit and we'd skip the child activity.

4502,Is my husband a narcissist?,"I’ve (25 F) been married to my husband (28 M) for about 9 months now. Last week, he decided he wanted a divorce and then told me he needs space for a week to be able to fully make that decision so he kicked me out of my house (our names are both on the lease). The following day, he told me he was staying with a friend so I found it odd I wasn’t allowed to stay in my own home. I reached out to one of his friends (who has become my friend over the years as well) for advice. He just ignored my text. I did the same with his sister and mother and neither of them responded as well. I went home on Tuesday because I knew he was at work and I needed a quiet place to do a zoom call. I also decided to do some of his laundry and dishes since I knew he was probably running low on work clothes. On Wednesday, I told my husband I was going to move back in since he wasn’t staying their. I received a text back where he called me disrespectful. I was disrespectful for involving others, going into my own home without informing him (even though he was at work), telling him I was moving home (even though he’s been at his friends since Monday), and contacting him through text at all. I was only allowed to send him a goodnight text and he didn’t have to respond was what he had decided were the “rules” on Sunday. That night was the last text I sent him. I just made a plan for us to meet today (Sunday) so we could discuss next steps. Yesterday he texted me saying he needed more time because I have violated his space everyday except for Friday (my birthday. Yes he did this right before my birthday). He won’t give me any sort of timeline on when he’ll be ready to talk. Just that he’ll text me when he is. He believes my urgency to want to talk to him about our next steps must mean I’m pregnant. Like there’s no other explanation for me not wanting to be in limbo or completely cut off from my person. He has also cut off any communication I’ve had with his family and friends. They all immediately go to him if I’ve contacted them in any sense. Please no advice. I already know what I’m doing, I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced this before.

4512,Afraid,I have made the decision to leave my narc soon. We have been together 9 years married for 4. We have two children together and I have another child from a previous relationship. At first it was like narc was a knight in shining armor. Then over the years it was like subtle changes narc made to gain control. After we got married it was like narc took of the mask. I cnt watch certain tv shows. I cnt worship how I want. I cnt wear certain clothes out. I took care of the bills and the children while narc did little to nothing to help provide. I ignored all the red flags and married narc anyway bc I thought you know everything can’t be perfect in a relationship. A year before we got married I became frustrated and tired and bc of that I  cheated with somebody else. I know I’m a bad person for cheating and I won’t make excuses about it. After narc found out about it narc blew up at me as I expected and called me all sorts names and talked about me to everyone that would listen. Months later narc said we would work on this and that narc forgave me. Now every argument every misunderstanding every bad thing I do the narc holds the guilt and cheating over my head. Now I’m making plans to leave narc bc I don’t want to have this being used as a weapon against me for the rest of my life. I’m just so afraid and anxious about telling narc that me and the kids are leaving.

4524,The Parasitic Narcissist,"My dad is a very extroverted malignant narcissist who is extremely self sufficient and utterly charming. He’s also the giant douche who has emotionally abused any/all who have come near him. 

With his pattern in mind, I was blind to see the narcissist in my very “sweet” socially awkward brilliant introverted soon to be ex-husband, I thought hooray! He is not a narcissist. 

Now that divorcing, I realize there are different forms of narcissism. My STBX was a giant parasite who had me run the household, provide maintenance for the cars, manage taxes, help him find jobs every year when his bosses had finally had enough of his “know-it-all” attitude, constantly provide him pep talks, organize his health appointments, remind him to take care of his basic hygiene daily, etc. He is the most non-functional adult I have ever met. The only thing he took care of is finances, and after careful review, I realize he ate up to $4000 a month in restaurants/fast food places/coffee shops. Why? Because he has to eat with his friends at lunch. Taking a lunch with him to work would mean loneliness and eventually suicide. 

Yet, when I legit needed physical/emotional support, he was too busy or needed me more than I needed him. 

When I got sick of being drained and dumped this soul-moocher, I was accused of “using “ him for having him follow me when I had to move across the country... after our wedding. 

Despite the obvious examples of a man who believes his needs are more important than any others, I was blind to these other examples. 
- jealousy toward my gay best friends
- competitiveness with me in the gym despite me being 150lbs smaller
- smugness that offended and shrunk my social circles
- constantly throwing me under the bus with family/friends and denying he did anything wrong
- absolute refusal to admit fault in all cases
- willingness to budge on a request, only after he has something to gain or a chip he can use for later bargaining.  (Wow... I fee so used. ) 
-yet, when all is lost, he is the most wonderful/thoughtful/apologetic man alive
- denying me the right to buy new clothes/shoes while he purchased thousands of dollars in suits
- completely ignoring my stories and comments. I had to ask him to at least pretend he heard me speak. I was lucky to get an “mhmm.”


He really fooled me for 3 years. I thought he was just overly coddled by his family. But no. He’s a narc. It’s only because of the divorce and the time I’ve had to heal that I recognize his narcissism. 

Narcissism can come in many forms. 

It makes me nervous to date again in the future. After his outlandish requests to lay claim to my future enlarged paycheck, I am really hesitant to ever marry anyone again.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4526,Am I in a toxic relationship? TW: self harm mentions,"I want to start this off by saying that im unsure whether or not im in a toxic relationship, And I really need advice on how to leave him when I dont want to. I have various personal issues which make it hard for me to leave and I get attached to people. We met just over a year ago and he was the sweetest, I would never even think once that he has cheated (Nor would I to this day). He comforted me when I was sad, was there for me, loved me and was just a really good person. Fast forward a couple of months, he starts acting off… tells me to delete all of my male contacts and friends off of my phone, and that im not allowed to have male friends. Then soon it turned to some female friends. Then I had no friends. Then he started saying I cant wear shorts or any “revealing” clothes even in 90-100 degree summer weather, okay, fair enough. It just got more and more and more, I had to delete my socia media accounts and apps, I couldn’t wear makeup out anymore, I cant even sing anymore. When I cut myself I have to full on hide it from him or else he threatens to leave. I feel isolated and trapped now, I know I should have left sooner but It was hard because I knew in his heart hr was a sweet guy. And dont get me wrong, there is times where we will have a lovely day, we will sweet talk with eachother , hang out and be affectionate. I love the kind of bond we have when we arent fighting or arguing. Its just so hard to leave and I dont know why. Not to mention when we argue its always my fault and he rarely says sorry (If he does its days later and its when we are being sweet towards one another). Either that or he gets mad at me for explaining to him how him not apologizing hurts my feelings. I just dont know what the next step would be, and all the times we have “broke up” (It was always him who “broke up with me”), I always find myself running back to him. Advice?

4528,Husband went out for Maalox and came home 6 hours later,"My (40f) husband (41m) is a busy man. He works a lot, probably less than he says but I know it’s still a lot. He works from 7-5 comes home for an hour or two then is off till meetings from 7-10/11pm. 

We’ve been together for almost 18 years and we have a 4 year old. I feel like being at home is a chore for him, he is always looking for excuses to go out for coffee with his friends or drinks.

Last weekend he was out until 5/6am with his friends. The only day we see him is Sunday and he spent most of that day sleeping. This is very common behavior, he says it helps him with the stress of his job.

This weekend again he says he’s going out with said friend, I was not happy and he asked if I preferred to stay home, I said yes, he changed out of his clothes into his sweats. An hour later he said he had acid reflux and was going to the pharmacy to get Maalox. That was it, he didn’t come home until 4 am. I’m so upset, I told him this is totally unacceptable and I’m going to stop considering his involvement in our family life since he only considers himself. 

This morning he got woke up, washed up and went out to “grab a coffee”, we were chatting and I brought up I didn’t even consider him in our day yesterday and I’ve started just planning for my daughter and me. 

He went into a rage and said he was going to start doing the same. How is it even possible for him to consider us any less?? I’m flabbergasted. I moved from my home country and am alone here with no real career prospects. I feel so hurt and alone, I don’t want to break up my family but I feel deeply unhappy and can’t believe that I, who once had a career and large friend group, now finds myself completely alone with a husband that only plans for himself and his day and I feel like I’m desperately trying to schedule family time that he is always resisting. 

I am in therapy but it’s not really helping. I try to make plans with friends here but it’s such a big effort that is never reciprocated. If I want to be social I have to invite friends over for dinner or make the plans, otherwise it’s silence. This is so hurtful, I’ve never felt so unwanted and unloved. 

Tl;dr: My husband beats to the rhythm of his own drum. He goes out for coffee/drinks everyday,  sometimes until 4-5am. Last night he said he was going out for Maalox and didn’t come home until 4 am. I feel unhappy and stuck.

4530,My relationship is draining me,"My boyfriend (25) and I (24) had a fight an hour ago. I planned to go to a piercing shop, and he offered to accompany me. The shop was 30 minutes away from my place and an hour from his. I didn't want him to commute that far for a quick session, so I told hin that he didn’t have to. He had planned to have dinner after, but changed his mind after I explained. He asked why I hadn't thought of having dinner with him. I admitted I considered it but hesitated, lacking extra money for leisure as I prefer to contribute when we go on dates. In the end, we decided to meet eventually.

The piercing shop was closed, so we just had dinner. On our way home, I suggested stopping by a coffee shop for more time together, and that's when he went cold. I asked him what the problem was, and as we walked to my home, he said that if money was a concern, we could have gone to a cheaper place or a fast-food restaurant. I told him I hadn't thought of it, and he questioned why did I said I had considered it reasoned I didn't have money. I asked him about the point of the argument when we were already together.
To provide some background, I always commute to his place, even on weekdays after work and weekends. I make time for him, but I don't understand the need to ruin our night with such an argument. It seems like he just wanted to argue. He's good at it, aware of his skills, he even mentioned how he feels the urge to argue for someone in the wrong during conversations with his friends.

Scenario 1: I caught him following a number of girls on IG, wearing sexy clothes or bikinis, whom he didn't even know. I asked him about it, and he turned the tables, mentioning I followed some known personalities/kpop groups. I follow some, but not to the extent of considering myself a fan. I don't see it as the same thing, as I'm not really into K-pop and barely have followers/following on IG. To me, it's idolizing, and his was fantasizing.

He also has a quick temper and punches the table or the wall when angry. It's draining. He's my second boyfriend, and coming from a previous relationship where I experienced constant cheating and nonchalant behavior, my current boyfriend is a definite upgrade.

tl;dr My boyfriend likes arguing over everything and it’s draining. He is also a quick tempered. Despite that he is sweet, kind, generous and family oriented. I don’t see someone better than him.

They're from the brand weworewhat, I have never purchased panties from them. I own a few things from them that I purchased years ago, but not panties. I am a SAHM with little social life, there are only two friends of mine whose they could be (both comfirmed they're not theirs). My mother is the only other woman who comes here, is 65, and is not buying panties from a niche 20-something TikTok ""it girl"" site.

My husband (M25) was laid off in November, and is still in the process of finding a new job. I say this to mean he has pretty much been with me 24/7 for months. I don't go out or see my friends often at all, I am mostly always with him, our daughter, or both. His father has also been staying with us since before he was laid off, so he cannot just have a girl over here even if by some chance I was away long enough.

I would never expect him to cheat but some other girls panties did not just spawn into my dryer.

4537,My bf’s conditions,"
I ( 30 F ) has been dating my bf ( 30 M ) since last june. We are from different ethnicities.He’s white American and im brown. I gained like 3 kg during summer and became 63kg. Which is bit chubby with my height ( 168 cm ) after a couple of months i joined the gym and now i’m 59kg. My ideal goal is to get to 53kg. My bf brought up my weight as an issue and if I don’t work on myself to loose my weight the relationship wouldn’t work. I try to ignore that he didn’t just say that but he kept on bringing it up. 

Last month i got some acne after eating seafood and the marks are persistent to fade. I do my skin care routine everyday but it has slow progress. So my acne was his second condition. 

I got naturally curly hair and i got curly bangs. Everyone love my hair and they love it even more after i got my bangs ( like 2 years ago) he wants them to be gone cause the hair covers my face. I put on a hair band and push the hair out of the way if it gets hot or anything. Thats the 3rd condition 

Im a huge fan of anime and cartoons and I didn’t had access to any merchandise when i was growing up. So my day today clothes got atleast one character in them. I wear formally for parties and functions but my casual wear all are cute stuff. Thats his other condition. Change the way j dress up casually.

I dunno how to respond to these in an understanding way. He’s not diagnosed but he does show signs of autism spectrum. All these time i used that as an excuse to ignore these but the list keep on getting longer. I’m a hopeless romantic  but this feels like a business agreement.

4544,My (20F) boyfriend (24M) is being creepy.,"I need some advice on how to deal with his strange behavior. we have been dating for one year and I really love him but lately he has been showing some red flags that are making me question his sanity and our relationship. 

&#x200B;

first of all, he is very secretive and possessive and i have caught him snooping through my things many times already when i wasn't looking. sometimes he says some really creepy jokes and i can tell he hides his emotions.

secondly, i found out he had installed something in my phone to track my location, and i originally let it slide and accepted it, but i also caught him following me in public when i had no idea he was following. i asked him about it and it turned into an argument to which he then told me that it was not the first time he followed me and that he had done it to ""protect me"" Sometimes whenever we have disagreements he exalts himself and tells me he knows what's best for me. thirdly, he doesn't tell me much about his life and only gives vague details and whenever he gives more details they are usually inconsistent and don't make sense when it is given a lot of thought.

Fourth, he gets angry easily whenever any cuddling and sex is initiated, and almost becomes a different person when angry. I can see that he gets visibly annoyed and anxious whenever sex is mentioned at all, and he won't tell me why. We have only had it three times, and I think it was on the third and last time that he cried in the middle of it, and I had comforted him and he told me that it really makes him uncomfortable. After he felt better, I hugged him and it made him climax. what really began to scare me is that he knew about my friends before I introduced him to them, and they didn't even know him before I introduced him. 

My parents like him and he is very sociable around them, but seems annoyed with my friends and goes silent, not engaging in group conversations when we all go out together. He always dismisses me when I tell him to address his strange behaviors and gives unclear answers if i do get him to address them.He never kisses me or hugs me unless i do it first, and keeps checking my devices, which is why i made this throwaway, and checks my clothes and anything i buy even when I tell him to stop. I have woke up to him watching me sleep from the edge of the bed but I didn't say anything and went back to sleep. at this point I do not know what to do, how do i deal with his behavior?

4545,I’ve left my SO because he keeps disrespecting my boundaries,"My F39 partner M45 and I have been together 3.5 years and lived together in his house for 2.5 years. I gave up everything, house and job to be with him. 

I would say it’s been quite rocky since we’ve moved in together, but mostly good times, we work well together, laugh and mostly enjoy each other’s company.

Thing is, he’s got a wandering eye. Looks/stares, comments, compliments and flirts with females openly whilst in my company. I do not believe he has ever actually cheated, so I will shut that down now. (We live together, have passcodes on phones which we both know, no hiding/being secretive with them, in each others company a lot, he phones to let me know where he is. He has not cheated.)
I have told him many MANY times that I am uncomfortable with this and set a boundary about a year ago that it stops after an incident in a restaurant.

About this incident…. His ex approached him to chat, I walked away with the couple we were with to find a table because - I’m not interested. I made a comment to this other couple in regards to her hygiene. She was very drunk, in very revealing clothing, no underwear, sitting with people who like a lot to drink regularly who were old enough to be her grandfather. Throughout the evening my SO kept looking over, I followed his gaze and he was staring at her. She flipped, started pointing her finger, shouting and screaming. The couple we were with were laughing saying that they believe she’s shouting at me! My SO did nothing. Said I deserved it because I provoked her.  I blocked her from his social media. This caused an argument and I set the boundary that he stops this nonsense (staring, flirting etc) whilst in front of me.

Last week, again, out, she walks past our table and he’s like oh hi! As if they were long lost friends. I walked out. 

I’ve followed through and managed to get new accommodation set up, it’s all happened so quickly, but I can’t go on like this. He’s calling me childish and immature for ending our relationship. Is this immature? He says that if he backs down now then I will continue to tell him to stop speaking to exs. I just want him to have my back. Is that too much to expect?

TL;DR I’ve left my SO for not having my back when it comes to his ex.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4546,i (21f) feel like my bf (21m) is trying to change me so i can be like other girls,"posting on throwaway as my bf follows my main account.

my bf and i have been dating for a year and we have a really good relationship. i love him a lot and i see a great future with him. but i’ve noticed since pretty early in our relationship, he’ll say things that suggest that he wants to mold me into someone else. the biggest way he does this is with clothes. i usually take pride in how i dress and have a super girly/feminine style because i think it’s cute and makes me feel good. i also find it cool to not dress like everyone else because at the college we go to, all the girls wear at athleisure wear which is fine but everyone looks the same. for a long time, he would constantly tell me “you should wear these clothes. you would look so hot. ”, “why don’t you wear this and that”, “you would look so good in this and that” “i see girls wearing this brand all the time, you should get clothes from there too” and all these clothes were the same thing all the girls around us wear. it made me feel sad that he wanted me to conform so bad but i leaned into it and started dressing like them and he would always compliment me and tell me how good i looked which was nice.

but today, he did the same thing with my gym outfit choice and it just made me feel so bad. i just feel like he’s not appreciating who i am and is trying to conform me into what he finds most attractive, which also makes me feel pretty shitty because i think everyone wants to be found attractive by their partner and not constantly reminded that you’re not that attractive to your partner? i also don’t know if im overreacting either lol. thoughts?

4555,Feeling insecure about myself after I pressured my boyfriend to reveal his type to me.,"We're in our early 30s.

My boyfriend of almost two years revealed to me, after I admittedly pestered him to reveal his sexual preferences, that he likes a flat stomach.

I've been very insecure about my body, even when I was underweight. I used to be 125lbs soaking wet and I'm nearly six foot. I was seen as very attractive and people would often say I should model. 

I ended up gaining weight quick due to an autoimmune disease that messed with my whole body, metabolic included. I've struggled with my weight since, losing 120lbs before I met him but then gaining 40 of it back recently due to the pain of being active (I became sedentary as after a 30 minute walk I was limping badly for days). I'm sitting at being morbidly obese, but I do try and take pride in my makeup and hair styling abilities. My body may not be fantastic but I have a stunning face still. I also try and wear clothes that accentuate my, now more hidden, natural hourglass figure.

I understand that I shouldn't be upset with him for revealing what he likes. In fact I always sort of assumed. He says he finds me very attractive and our sex life is good - very passionate indeed. But I can't help but feel my inner hatred towards myself resurfacing after his comment. 

I'm starting on a new med that will hopefully alleviate me of the majority of the pain and fatigue I experience. I also am in neurological therapy to work on my dizziness and unbalanced gait. I'm hoping that in time I can become active again, because I do miss it a lot.

My boyfriend has been phenomenal through this whole thing and I know he loves me deeply. He wouldn't have stuck around all the hospital and doctor visits if he didn't. He is truly a blessing. But I'm admittedly feeling even more insecure than usual. I also know that he likes me when I'm feeling more confident as I am aware that's another turn on for him. 

How can I work on this insecurity? I am in mental health therapy, so that helps in general. But is there any way that I can reframe this situation? I'm not mad at him, just disappointed in myself for pressuring him to reveal and also that I'm morbidly obese.

TLDR : I don't have the body I want or used to have due to an autoimmune condition and some laziness. My boyfriend of 2 years revealed, after I pressured him, that he prefers women with flat stomachs. Now I'm feeling more insecure and disappointed in myself. Do I'm wondering how to maybe reframe things.",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4561,I (22 f) found out my bf (29 m) and friend (23 f) have been texting each other,"My bf (29 m) and I (22f) been dating each other for 3 years. We’ve been in a long distance relationship for a while, but this year I finally decided I’m ready to live with him. Today I decided to go through my bf phone to sent myself a Snapchat pic so we don’t lose out Snapchat streak together. I also send a random Snapchat pic of the floor to his other friends on Snapchat. (He has my other friends on Snapchat and other social media, but it’s ok since I also have some of his friends on my social medias.)

But today I decided to go through his Snapchat messages with my friend JJ (23 f). I was shocked about what I just read. It was my bf asking JJ for her address to send her clothes for Shein. Her reply was her address and “I only accept cute clothes”. Then I saw my bf sent a screenshot of his shein cart full of clothes such as tiny short, bralettes, sexy costumes like maid and school girl. 

I confronted my bf about his conversation with JJ and he told me that he wanted to buy those clothes for me and asked JJ for advice. I told him that he’s lying since he asked for her address to sent the clothes to her. He kept telling me that “it’s not what it looks like” and “I’m only loyal to you”.

I texted JJ about this and she told me that my bf never asked for her address. Obviously I knew that was a lie too. I was crying so much at this point. I felt betrayed by my bf and friend. 

I don’t know if I should move back to my parents house or continue to live with my bf since my name on the lease for our apartment. Both JJ and my bf been spamming me, but I’ve been ignoring them. I need advice on this since I don’t know what to do.

I don't know if he has logged anything onto my cell phone but I just got it factory reset yesterday and changed every password that I can think of. 

He seems to think that any conversation with someone of the male gender is cheating on him. I don't have the financial means to move out having just gotten a job that pays a little above minimum wage?

I've taken my phone off the wifi, added a VPN, yesterday we were having sex and he accidentally hurt me badly enough I still was in pain the next day.

4576,Conflicting feelings,"Hi everyone, I'd love to have some validation, guidance, something? On my current situation. 
I have a child (F2) with a man (M30) I have not lived with in over a year, during that time we have had many conflicts mainly from the fact that we didn't live together and the logistics of sharing time with our daughter. He is not what I would call an overtly nice person but he can kind and compassionate. 
He tends to be very loud and say VERY hurtful things when he is upset but he rarely gets physical (only once before I moved out). It's not ok and I understand verbal abuse is just as damaging but I genuinely love this man and I want a family together. 
Which brings us to current events, after staying the night at his place there was a disagreement over something literally so stupid and insignificant which resulting in me wanting to leave with my daughter. I was calmly walking away and he bent down and grabbed her, pushing me away, and told me she wasn't going anywhere. This lead to me calling the police and him being arrested ( I didn't press charges the state did). He's since been released but there is a no contact in place. 
He's never been abusive towards his daughter and I don't fear for my safety, should I try to modify the no contact early or let things play out until after he goes to trial? Does any one have experience with no contact?
 Every one is urging me to take legal actions ( restraining  orders ect) to make a good case if there is a custody trial ( there is nothing currently in place) but that doesn't feel right to me.

4579,Insults he claims are just his sense of humor…?,"My (f30) on and off boyfriend (m30) often makes jokes that poke fun at my physical appearance. A few examples from just last weekend:

he said my make up looks like I have been applying it the same way since I was a kid/ that it was evident I’ve been wearing makeup for that long considering the wear and tear on my skin (I have acne scars, wrinkles, etc). 

He make a joke about my shoe size being a 12 at the bowling alley (my shoe size is 7.5- no where near a 12) 

We were in Marshall’s and pointing out a pair of women’s pants we both liked and I said “oh but they’re a size large” and he replied “well that is your size, isn’t it”. I’m 5’6” 135lbs and large is not the size I would typically buy and he knows this 

So I confronted him about all of this and asked that he does not make any more jokes about my physical appearance. He immediately raised his voice and suggested that I’m overreacting. He insisted that it was harmless humor and that if I’m trying to change these jokes than I’m trying to change a big part of him because he makes jokes like this with everyone that he loves and it’s an innate part of his personality and his relationships etc. he also suggested that if he can’t poke fun at my physical appearance than he may as well say nothing about it at all and he will make sure to stop complimenting me and telling me when I look nice.

There are episodes of are argument that he had been physically hurting me. The worst happened last time, we are at the mall and he got annoyed be. There are people who had seen us and even the guard had come to talk to us. He was squeezing my arms and thighs so angrily that it left a dark bruises now. I asked him to stop because people can see us. I declined on the guards asssistance and said that we will talk it outside to lessen the commotion.

When we got out, he forced me to go home with him. He lectured me that I was in the wrong that is why he did it. He choked me and I said sorry for all of it. After sometime his anger subsided, he was begging for forgiveness that he only done it because of his emotion. This is not the first time he did this but he said that he will not do it again. Leaving seems like not an option. I love him but it is also scary to leave him.  I do not know what to do since he is really good now if there is no arguments and just a normal day for us. If you are telling me why an I not leaving? It is complicated, the more these kind of people with anger issues know that you are leaving, the more they are going to be angry.

4591,She doesn’t know that I know…,"A friend of mine is in a relationship/married to an abuser. I know he is an abuser because he is also my ex. I had a couple flings with him when we were teenagers and long story short he cheated on me and actually kicked me at school. I was so young I didn’t recognize that behavior as abusive and just outright evil. 
Context: My friend is not very close to me but our kids have play dates and we have multiple mutual friends.

This guy is a big deal in our town. Without giving too much away, he’s a performer and loved/admired by many. My sibling is also a performer with him and recognizes that his friend is abusive too. They used to live together and my sibling saw him choking is now wife and mother of his child (my friend).

The only reason why I know he is abusive to her is because of my sibling who is also friends with her. They told me about the choking incident many years back and now I recently heard from my sibling that they are separated because of his behavior. My sibling says that he pushed her in a closet when she was pregnant, kicked her while she was driving and hopped on her car while she tried to drive away with their kid inside. 

I told my sibling straight out that I will not be associating myself with this guy anymore and that my sibling should consider the same. I feel in my gut I need to do something, it’s such a dark secret. My friend and her husband are pretending to be fine on social media and for their child. She does not know that I know and it’s eating me up inside. Just found this all out over Christmas weekend and my heart breaks for her and her child. 

How do I go about this? Part of me wants to tell her what happened to me when I was younger and dating him… but I don’t want her to feel like it’s coming out of left field.

4592,That uneasy feeling at the beginning of getting to know your abuser…,"Was it there for you? There was once an expert on abusive relationships whose name I can’t remember on Oprah who said that most women who end up in an abusive relationship report a feeling of unease which they felt early on in the relationship but suppressed.

By this point, nothing bad had happened and I was excited for our next meeting.

A couple of weeks after that, we met for the second time, this time one on one, and it went really well, we said our goodbyes in a good mood and he texted me soon after. No later than the next day I felt literally nauseous and super uneasy about him but only for about 10 minutes and then it went away. I was considering calling our next meeting off but then the feeling went away and once again I dismissed it. Now I know this was my intuition.

He has charisma and is somewhat succesful, funny smart, but somehow always after seeing him I feel angry for some reason and sulky and normally I'm happy. I can't really put my finger on it. 

The most important thing is he said that he studied forbidden psychology where you can manipulate someone to do anything with some particular words. And he said he studied it so he can sleep with alot of women, because he was chubby in the past, even tho he was not ugly by any means. 

He also said that he has been with alot of women and I didn't know why he said that to me. 

He says I'm very cute and have a good heart and that's why he chose me (therefore i guess easy to manipulate). 

He is very intelligent and talks alot but says he cant disclose everything from his past, which makes me feel its questionable, also he mentioned that. 


Also he said all his women have had mental issues in the past and he chose them because of that. That they won't judge him, for his interests, because thry have been through alot, which also brings questions.

Yeah,ain't been fun, folks. Ain't been fun.

&#x200B;

\---------------------

&#x200B;

This happens every few weeks. It's a fucked up cycle.

Now I'm asking reddit. **I KNOW HOW IT SOUNDS.** I know objectively it's not an okay thing to do. I know that using a yardstick for measuring severity of abuse and trauma isn't appropriate either. And yet--and fucking yet--if ""it"", the knowledge that what happened was fucked up, sinks in, it doesn't stay there. It goes away, almost predictably. It's like my mind and body can't hold onto it.

Please just tell me your opinion. Again, **I know how it sounds.**

I'm only going to describe one thing that happened over and over and over again, so much so that I thought it was a normal thing, a routine thing, a thing that everybody must do:

My (5""4, 110 pound)  ex-boyfriend and future ex-husband (6""0, formidable figure, at least to me) usually blocked the bedroom door with his body. Wouldn't let me leave even when I begged, like a dog, and pleaded, and cried, like a fucking dog. Instead, he taunted me. Jeered at me. Laughed at me, all while holding onto the sides of the doorway, and barring me with his torso, arms, and legs, even when I tried to crawl through by his legs to get to the front door and just leave. Told me nobody loved me. That I was useless. Ridiculous. Pathetic. A child. Incapable. A living joke. Intolerable. Insane. Crazy. Even when I was pregnant. The one time I lashed out to get through I felt so guilty--i thought it was proof I was as bad as he said he was.

So I'd give up. Sit on the bed, a few times with my infant, and he'd just jeer and go on and on and laugh. Like he enjoyed it. I don't know what there was to enjoy. I wasn't responding. Just had tears, and begging, and trying to reason. Then I think I stopped crying.

I laughed when talking about it today then immediately felt so embarrassed, so ashamed--so gross. Couldn't stand up straight. Thought, well, that person won't believe me anyway, I must look and sound fucking crazy.

POTENTIAL TRIGGER WARNING BELOW

Slight backstory for better context: the relationship was always toxic, but this is the incident where things got physical. My abuser was intoxicated and kept saying he could get away with r@ping me if he wanted to. He repeatedly pinned me down to the bed with his body weight and wouldn't let me get up. When I finally managed to get away, I ran outside and called the cops (I didn't know what else to do, he was being aggressive and I was scared). That’s when he followed me outside and struck me from behind.

Though I shouldn’t have to explain, him referring to me as being “mean” and “rude” is because I grew distant. I was extremely unhappy in the relationship and he knew that. I tried to end it numerous times, but he always threatened to ruin my life if I left. To make matters worse, we had an apartment together (which he couldn’t afford alone) and when I asked him to sign to take my name off or take his off he refused.

Of course, once a narcissist always a narcissist.. but him refusing to have any accountability and turning this on me hurts. According to him, the only reason he hit me was because of my own doings.

(Calls me over emotional, disagrees with my version of any event, moves blame onto me, tells me “normal people” would act differently to me etc.) 
What I can’t reconcile is that he is doing this on purpose or would know that he is doing it. But it is definitely a repetitive pattern and I have begun to change my behaviours to avoid any conflict (even though I am told I’m always trying to start an argument). 
This is becoming a repetitive cycle and I am coming to the conclusion that for the sake of myself and my children I will have to leave. But I get a feeling of guilt, that this is my fault, that I have made him like this, that he doesn’t realise he is doing it. Everything I read suggests that gaslighters know exactly what they are doing and he is trying to manipulate me. Do they know? He certainly knows the term and once told me I was gaslighting him. I’m so totally confused, and sometimes I think maybe I am the bad person here. Or maybe no-one is bad but it’s poor communication. But I know I try hard to not call him names, to talk about how I feel, but try not to blame. I don’t think he puts any thought into what he says to me.

4617,I dont know what to do. Can he change?,"Feeling confused, sad, and exhausted and dont know what to do.

I (32F) have been with my partner (34M) for 12 years. We have 2 kids and own a house together. I came into this relationship with a lot of emotional baggage, and have had periods of depression and suicidal thoughts during the years. But I have fought through a lot and now I take pride in where I am today. 

However, as I have started feeling better about myself, my partner has become more and more critical about almost everything I do. 

- If the house is not spotless and a home cooked meal is on the table when he gets home, both me and the kids get a scolding. We never know what mood he will be in that day.

- He is unhappy with the way I dress, have my hair, do chores, take care of the kids. He says I always forgets things and ”can’t think”. He also says to our children if they forget things: ”you’re just like mommy, you can’t think”

- He is never happy for me or congratulates me on acheivements. When I got a promotion he didnt talk to me for a week. He makes me feel embarrassed and says that I only care about my career and not the family. I recently got an offer to work at another company and when I told him he said no, I am not allowed.

- When he gets drunk he says extremely hurtful things and never apologises. 

- He forbids me from doing things like using nicotine pouches (common in our country, and ok for him when other people do) 

- He constantly threatens to break up for all the things I do wrong.

I can make a long long list of behaviours that I have been accepting for 5+ years. But I feel that I am at the end, I can’t take anymore. I’m exhausted from trying to keep him happy. I have been distancing myself for the last few weeks, and have finally mentally prepared to leave.
 But now he tells me that he wants to talk and go to therapy. 

What are your insights and tips for where I’m at? If he changes, I want to stay. But I don’t want to deal with the constant critisism and abuse anymore. 

I also feel that I am not afraid of his threats of breaking up anymore, and actually curious to see how he will react if I stand my ground and dont give in to the threats. Do anyone have a positive story?

4629,I don’t know what to do.,"My husband and I were in the bathroom just now, we have a small chair in there. he was sitting on the chair scrolling on his phone while I was organizing some stuff, we were chatting. 
I noticed something on his back. It was just some paint from a project with our son last night. When I realized what it was I told him I was going to wipe it, he still hadn’t said anything so I thought it was fine but when I went to wipe it off he shoved me pretty hard and yelled he didn’t want to be “bothered and poked” right now. Stunned and like an idiot I said “stop just let me get the paint off” and tried to wipe it again and he shoved me a second time, then got up stormed down the hallway cursing and making quite a bit of noise. 
Our son was napping but he woke him up, he did fall back asleep in a few min but it breaks my heart he woke up to his dad cursing and stomping down the hall. I’m at a loss. 

I told my friend bc she happened to call and could tell something was wrong. 
she said that something must be bothering him bc it’s not like him and that he loves me, it seemed like she was saying it wasn’t a big deal. It seems like a big deal to me.

What if I hit my head? I was near a corner with tile. I couldn’t help but think about all the what ifs. What if I and hit my head? would he have cared? Would I still be laying there now if I had passed out from the fall? I could have got hurt. He hasn’t come to apologize or look for me, it’s been two hours.

He’s a strong guy. I shouldn’t have been in his personal space I suppose but to shove me that hard and twice scared me.

I had a ton of work to do while my son napped today but now I can’t do anything but sit on the floor in the corner of my office trying to be as quiet as possible typing this.

im autistic and its always been hard for me to leave ppl when ive been with them for some time, we have been together for over a year. not that long, but for me it is for me. but, the reasons he is abusive is because he will drive fast when he’s mad at me, he doesnt let me cry, he doesnt allow me to talk and he makes me yell when i dont want to and then tells me to stop yelling because he has a headache. he has covered my mouth when i was expressing myself. hes pushed me on the ground and broke my glasses. i feel so stuck, i love him but hes not gonna change i gave him over a year, he’s cheated on me and hurt me physically and emotionally. i need help and advice, i feel like ill be so alone and ill be broken and lost, hes my only friend. when i finally stop crying and drop it for him he just always talks about himself constantly he always brings up weed, i just feel weird and i know i need to leave but im sooo stuck. also i once called him mom to tell her that he was physically hurting me and rolling me around on the ground and grabbing me and she time me i could handle it myself because im a big girl.

4636,How do I know if it was sexual assault/rape..,"TW: sexual abuse, sexual violence, coercion, 

Recently kissing with one random guy  triggered my trauma and since then I can’t stop thinking about one incident with my ex. It happened a year ago. One time we went out clubbing with my friends and I ended up drinking all night. By the end I was completely blackout drunk. I couldn’t even  stand on my legs. 

He took me to the public bathroom and… I don’t remember anything happening afterwards. Only small little gaps - i remember how exhausted and numb I was, thinking that it was going for ages and wishing it would end fast. But I never said anything, I don’t even know if I was conscious at all .. And I vividly remember the end, how relieved I was when he finished and as soon as he let me go I just fell down as there was nothing to hold on to. And he just left me there alone and naked, on the floor.  My arms were covered in bruises. The next day I told him I don’t remember anything at all and he told me that « it’s a pity, he enjoyed it a lot ». 

Half a year ago before this happened  he also told me he wants to penetrate me when I am unconscious. I did nothing about it. How do I say no to a person who  starts immediately punishing me for refusing?  There has been a lot of sexual coercion in our relationship for several years (which I discovered thanks to kind people in Reddit) so I forgot about this option. 

But it is driving me crazy now...

But I’m disabled and I homeschool our child. We have dogs I can’t leave behind. It’s not an emergency so it’s not like I’m in need of a shelter, but it’s depressing and miserable.

 I can’t work full time because I’m disabled, I have no income right now anyway besides Uber eats which doesn’t pay hardly a thing, and I can’t send my child to public school he has needs that the public schools here have proven to not be able to support. So I’ll have to work nights, but what job can I get that works nights but isn’t full time and also pays for rent. There isn’t any. It doesn’t exist here. I’ve spent the past year trying to find something. Waiting to hear from disability. I was denied. In my state that was expected. But what now? 

I tried filling out a form for section 8, just to be hopeful but the website is literally broken and I’m tech savvy it’s literally broken and I can’t get through to anyone to help and the website states they will not accept any paper applications no exceptions. 

I’m trying to get back into therapy, I have a care manager who can only really say “well work on finding income and filing a disability appeal, it’ll take awhile.” But I just feel so defeated.

***

I told him my situation with my parents that are abu**, he told a PASTOR, A MAN WE BARLEY KNOW about it. This man was being very creepy towards me  and provided information to this man and used ME to score points with him. If he introduces a man to me and he was a creep, HE PUT THE CREEP BEFORE ME and ignored my feelings of fear, one time he used it as a TEST, What if this obsessed guy kidnapped me? He never thought about that other than 'testing' me.

I told him every dark secret and anyone he gets in contact with tells EVERYONE my business


*** 

He had no sense of personal space or privacy and I do not care what he tells people now because I am safe and far away from him now.
 I will NEVER talk to anyone about my trauma again, men have used me, gossiped about me, laughed in my face, blamed me and sided with the abuser, from since I was born I was betrayed. The more I remember about him I feel such a deep pain of betrayal because he threw me under the bus to feel good about himself. If I did the same to him  he would act like an a**.  He literally gossiped about others trauma to show how much of a saviour he is for 'putting up with them' but dogged out people with mental illness ""because they have problems and are lazy"". He laughed at people that go to theraphy and emotionally shut down if things got serious or made a joke. When others opened up he would Make the conversation LOOK AT ME I WAS NEVER DEPRESSED NOR S*** THOUGH EVEN THOUGH I WAS TRAUMATIZED AND TREAT GOOD PEOPLE LIKE S** AND REFUSE THERAPY.  I'M SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU  and denies  his tone which is mocking and mimics the person as well and laughs at them if they did him wrong (self perceived because he blew up at anything).  When you call him out on his behaviour  he starts raging and discards people, he forgets all the things he does that were f** up  and wines about 'being a victim' and 'he can't trust no one'.

Over the course of 3 years he talked to everyone like garbage and got mad when people leave or do not give him attention (using people to improve his life and draining others).

4654,I don’t know if this is DV,"My husband loves me very much but he has problems regulating his feelings. His default emotion when he’s upset is anger. 

He has never hit me. But he yells at me alot, he grabbed my wrists a lot when he is angry and he pinned me down a few times and he slams doors when he is angry. 

I first noticed this issue 1 year into the relationship. There were 2 times when he was driving and he started yelling & I swore I thought I was gonna die. He drove SO fast in the parking lot I thought either I was gonna die or he was gonna knock someone down. 

I also have to say I was physically abused by my mother almost all my life growing up. & the first time my husband pinned me down, I almost had a panic attack.. I was kicking, crying and screaming hysterically & he just wouldn’t let me go.. That was a big fight we had. He told me He felt really bad and told me to call the cops on him. But I felt like that was silly to call the cops and I also didn’t want anything to happen to him. He seemed very apologetic and I told him how big of a deal that was and he can NEVER do that again no matter how angry he gets. 

He did it again and again. I get really scared when he starts raising his voice. He said I was being dramatic and sensitive and I have a problem cause he was just being passionate about his point and not yelling. He also said he never hit me (which is true) and I’m being dramatic that it’s not domestic violence. 

When he does apologize, he is very sincere and would ball his eyes out. He told me I should leave him for a better man. I don’t know what to do. When he’s not angry he’s perfect.

I was in the shower, and just randomly I had a  flashback of screaming ""Help, call 911"" at the top of my lungs. I wasn't screaming at anyone in particular. Just anyone who might hear me. This happened several times in my relationship and the flashback wasn't even of one particular time. Just the memory of feeling so desperate, and screaming like my life depended on it, because it did. 

It's been a year now since I left him. I can't tell you how amazing it's been not having to cover up bruises with makeup. Or waking up at 6 am, instead of falling asleep at 6 am because he kept me up all night fighting. To not have the overwhelming anxiety, even when things are going good, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

She messaged someone for help and they kicked down the door and her boyfriend beat up the couple that broke in to save her.. a woman ran up to me with a black eye and said he was holding her hostage while her boyfriend was getting pounded on by him. I knew she was serious about the situation and told a passerby to call the cops.. when the cops showed up, he had already fled on foot (mind you it’s a small town so everyone knows everyone) and a cop asked me what happened and after telling his name 2-3 times he asked me again and then asked me if it was someone else who he was to be looking for as if he was trying to get me to admit to saying it was someone else when he knew exactly who and what the situation was regarding and whom was holding her hostage.. Then he quickly left..The neighbor didn’t answer the door so the two officers stuck around town for awhile.

He has an active warrant but has not been arrested yet or done jail time for what he did.

I really do not want to be shamed for this, but I recently went back to him. I was trying my hardest to get away and stay away from him then my grandmother passed away. I went back. I needed someone and he was there for me. Then on new years, we got into another argument that turned into an explosive fight where he broke my bathroom door after I had locked myself in the bathroom to get away from him obviously. He stopped me from calling police on him and comforted me afterwards (literally tried to trauma bond with me over the fact that he broke my bathroom door) so I forgave him because I was terrified of what he would. I have since cut contact once he left my house, told him I do not want to talk to him ever again and all he said was ""alright"". I'm nervous by his quiet but hope he leaves me alone.

My last issue is, I don't know if I should call police and file a report. I told my apartment building the door broke by a freak accident (it's not that bad of a break where it's unbelievable) but I'm not sure they anyone heard anything or complained about any noise which would cause my apartment to question it. I'm not losing my housing over this, so if I have to file a report and tell them that I have a restraining order against him, I will.

I have bipolar and EUPD, I'm terrified that I've made it all up in my head, terrified that this is psychosis. How could I not realise for years? I'm so scared, he's my best friend, how can I run away?

4688,Confused and don’t know what to do,"My boyfriend (m45) and I (f44) have fought… a lot. We’ve been in a long distance relationship for 2 1/2 years, and about 3 months ago he moved across the country, I moved an hour away, and we joined households.

Last night, we had another fight, and he pushed me down.

I hit my head on our hardwood floors, and I was knocked out for about 2 minutes.

He called the EMS, and they were accompanied by the police.

He told them exactly what happened and owned everything.

And now he is in jail facing felony charges.

I don’t want to ruin his life.

I don’t want to think this is it.

I don’t know what to do.

I reached out to exactly one person in the past 24 hours, and she said he is dead, our relationship is dead to her, and if I don’t get out, I’m dead to her.

He called and asked for a couple of health items (glasses, etc) and I dropped them off at the jail tonight.

He wants me to take his ATM card to get cash for his bail tomorrow. It’s a massive amount, and I don’t feel comfortable taking it out, regardless of if it’s his account with his ATM pin which he gave me because I don’t want to get in trouble for using someone else’s ATM card.

I’m just lost as to what to do.

I don’t want him to suffer. 

I don’t think this is him - he’s not violent; it was a one off in a fight, and we were both saying horrible things to each other.

Me? I have been in an abusive marriage for 10 years and I’m finally getting ready to leave. About two weeks ago, my husband was using my Facebook on my iPad to access Facebook Marketplace. He doesn’t have his own account. I had just gotten to a place where I had decided to leave and was going to tell my closest friends. That’s when I realized that I had all my texts and iMessages going to both my phone and my iPad.

I lost all friends and family I knew, it’s hard for me because I feel I don’t have a voice and have to stay- I down have much money of my own and I work part time. 

He acts different now and is quiet, less loving and more telling me to get help. Blaming me for what I did. I feel like if I don’t do what he asks and let him have everything in his control he could turn around and say I assaulted him. 
When he is mad he raises his voice and sometimes throws objects but they miss me by a foot. Yet there are times he says I drive him insane and he could be better off without me.

4696,Don’t know how to go about this,"

Some background: So recently I’ve started talking to this guy. He’s tall, muscular, and just seemingly perfect. The moment we met we hit it off, he’s stayed with me since the 24th of January and today is now February 13, so of course we haven’t known each other that long. We are not officially dating, but we are very much so attached at the hip. 

Last night we decided to take some Xanax, nbd, we do it occasionally. (I mention this for a reason) 

So fast forward we start arguing around 5pm. We kept off and on arguing and this is where things get splotchy. Fast forward again, we took more Xanax, I’m not sure around the time. 

Around 4am we really started arguing. Of course the Xanax messed up my memory. He kept getting so frustrated with me and I didn’t understand why, either because of the drugs or I just don’t know what.

I was on my stomach on the bed and he was on his back, we were facing each other. We were arguing and this is where things get really splotchy. We start going back and forth arguing, kind of in each other’s face. Next thing I know I see a look of rage and he just grabs me. I was high from the Xanax/bad memory so I can’t remember if he grabbed my full face or my neck, but it was hard enough I went to the bathroom afterwards to see if he left a mark. I believe I just sat in disbelief then went to sleep. 

I feel like I’m in denial? Was this abuse? Was he joking? I don’t think he was joking? Things were going absolutely perfect I don’t see how he could go from 0-100? Any advice please. He’s still asleep and I’m writing this in the bathroom floor. Thank you in advance.


Update I’ve spoken with him. I asked if he remembered everything and he said yes and I said “ you grabbed me” and he said yeah it’s no different than when I grab you by the neck all the time, which he does do playfully. But I told him that is completely different. So he’s basically trying to justify grabbing my neck out of sheer rage by saying that it’s ok because he does it playfully.

4699,I need to leave but I don’t know how I can.,"Here is my story. I met my abuser back in 2011. We had a terrible first year with his first physical attack happening exactly a month after we started dating. Which happened to be the same night that he met my family. We then had a brief breakup and then I found out I was pregnant. He didn’t physically abuse me in this pregnancy however he did tell me to get an abortion because I was getting fat. Baby came and the relationship was going fine and then I got pregnant with my second child. This time he did hit me. And we had an audience as my little niece was staying with us at the time helping me around the house. Over the course of the last 10 years. I left and went back to him until now. I am black, he is white our children are of course biracial. Something came over the tv about race and I got upset and instead of being a supportive partner he screams he doesn’t care about those hard r n word. I sustained 10 years of suffering but this is the straw that breaks the camels back. You not only disrespected me but you are letting down your own children. 

I know it’s time for me to leave. The timing is just terrible as it’s right in the middle of the school year for my kids. They aren’t in any danger as their dad is not abusive towards them and he hasn’t physically abused me in over 3 years. I just need some advice. Some help.

4701,I live a life in fear and it's taken it's toll on me. I don't know if life is worth it.,"First of all I'm sorry for how long this will be. I just need to let out atleast 5% of what's inside of me.

I'm a (28F) who comes from a muslim and Arab family. I'm the only female in my family so I had to deal with all the misogyny and abuse on my own. I've been suicidal for as long as I remember. 

I remember being a kid and being very jealous of my brothers, they could do no wrong, but the minute I ""step out of line"" according to my parents, I would end beaten up, sometimes until I passed out. My mom dislocated my shoulder so many times, gave me black eyes. I remember going to school and lying about running into the door because I could never expose my parents like that, because I loved them.

I lived my life being shamed for who I am, for any little mistake I made, even if it wasn't. Like talking to a boy on Facebook because I like him. Or refusing to wear the scarf. Or wearing jeans that are not even tight. Or missing a prayer. Anything I've done was a grand mistake according to them. 

I lived thinking I was the worst thing that happened to my family and I hated it. I hated myself so much. I saw myself as a monster who was a curse to my family, and for that I tried to kill myself multiple times, to make life easier for them.


I fell inlove with someone who was from a different Nationality couple of years ago, my family ended up taking all my means of communication when they found out. I was 26 and locked inside of my room not allowed out. That was usual whenever my family would think I did anything wrong. They tricked me to agree to my home country, took my passport and didn't allow me back until I promised I would break up with him. I lied and said I did.

Now 1 year and a half later after what happened, I thankfully made it out. I have my own job and apartment. I have the support of my boyfriend who's been there to me financially, emotionally and everything. He's my rock and he ensured that I won't go back to that situation. 

The thing is, I'm still dealing with my parents stalking me at my work place and with my friends. My dad managed to get ahold of my passport and he's holding it as a leverage. The entire situation is too painful.

I'm just in pain and I need to let it out.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4704,I don’t know if I am abused or not,"
Hi everyone! I (21F) need insights about my relationship with my husband (27F). We got married last Oct and I am currently 8 months pregnant.

While dating I quit my job and he doesn’t want me to work outside. He wants me secluded. I can’t even go out to walk my dog. I am on life360 and he constantly monitors me. He wants to be always on the phone with me while he’s working. He also disregards my prozac bc he believes that I don’t need it. 

We had a huge fight last year and it’s physical and cops were involved. He took my phone away from me for the reason that he feels I am addicted to it and I fought back. He taunted me too about my traumatic abuse and I slapped him and things went crazy. 

We got back together and I know it’s stupid. I believed him and honestly it’s the shittiest decision I’ve ever made. I am not allowed to do whatever I want and he’s too harsh on reprimanding my dog. I feel like I am walking on a thin ice.

Also, we got again in another fight where we both said not nice things and I stupidly hit him while he’s driving around the block. And he hit me back too. We had a screaming match, it was bad that I felt like my stomach is hurting but thank God my baby is fine and healthy. 

Husband doesn’t seem to have a plan about the baby and he always told me that he will choose me over our baby which is upsetting but I can’t let this stress me since I don’t want my baby orphaned God forbid.

4709,Just need to know I'm normal,"I just found this sub so let me know if this has already been covered a ton.

I have had a couple triggering events recently and I just need to hear that I'm not the only one who thinks this way.

I was in an emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive relationship in my late teens and early twenties. I don't want to go over the whole thing but it was bad.

This was almost ten years ago now. I got out and did the back breaking work of recovery. I'm doing really good these days. I'm married to an amazing person, I just got my associates degree, my depression is well managed for the first time in my life.

The PTSD nightmares have all but stopped, sex is still really complicated for me but my husband is extremely patient and understanding and things are slowly but steadily improving.

Even still, it feels like I won't ever get to a place where I just don't care about my abuser. I want to not give him a second thought but it's hard. He joined the military a few years after I got away and I thought that would be it and I would never see him again. It had gotten to the point where weeks or even months would go by when I didn't think about him once.

I learned recently that he has moved back to the town we lived in where I've lived all along. I haven't run into him yet but it's a small town, it's going to happen sometime. Now I think about him constantly. Everywhere I go I expect him to be there. 

I just found out through a friend that he has a new girlfriend. She's only 22. We are both almost 30 now and I just know in my bones that he hasn't changed, that he's going to do to her what he did to me, or worse.

I'm obsessively worrying about her and hating him, but somehow some fucked up and horrible part of me is jealous of her. 

He was the kind of person who could make you feel like you were the most important, special, amazing person in the world, but only when it suited him. The rest of the time I would put up with anything, do anything, to feel that way again. There is still some part of me still wants it. Don't get me wrong, I am utterly and completely in love and faithful to my husband. I would never go back to my abuser, but he still has some amount of control over me after all this time and it makes me sick to my stomach.

I'm trying to focus on the present, that I have achieved everything and more than what he told me I never could. But it feels like there will always be a part of me that's still back there.

4717,Husband was arrested today for domestic violence,"He was arrested earlier today as we were approaching my car. A part of me feels relieved, confused, and guilty. All I ever wanted from him was the truth and to treat me right.  Whenever I would call him out on his obvious lies, he would get upset and angry. 

At this point, I feel so alone but hopeful for the future. I think about the woman I was before I married him. I was the person I always wanted to be and the person who I thought would never be in this situation. Today I feel like I don’t know the person I’ve become over the last 2 plus years. We go to church but I don’t feel as if God really honored our marriage. So many lies from the beginning that I did not discover until later. 


When he hit me and threatened my life three weeks ago, I was more concerned about him killing himself than what he did to me. Over the last few hours all I can think about is how my decision at this moment is so crucial. If I stay, it will only get worse because now he may be motivated to kill me.  

I’m confused by why the cops did not arrest him the night he hit me. I knew there was a warrant but why did they not arrest him before when they knew of his whereabouts? I just felt like that night I was so ready to be done and move on. I was so ready to start my new life until I came home to him the next day after I thought the locks were changed but not. I called the police then and they did nothing.  

Over the last three weeks, I thought about him hurting me in my sleep. Wanting to work it out but still that fear of the unknown. Spill trying to process everything.

4723,I need your point of view,"Hi! Posted my current situation here. 
 
Anyway just want to know if i am lacking and i need improvement as well. My spouse cheated on me(EA) with the same woman and been running for years (2022 when i officially caught them) and sometimes i feel it’s a bit of my mistake? 

I am a laidback person and I enjoy taking things slowly. I’m a pushover and I hardly say no if surrounded by mostly dominant personality. I am a submissive type of person as well. I can be confident but im too critical with myself especially if i made mistake or even if it isn’t my mistake. My husband is the total opposite, however more introvert than me. 

Sometimes when i look at him i try to think if i really do know him. We are dating since college and im a NBSB,so i don’t have that much experience. Since the EA, when he did good deeds i doubted it obviously with the sh*+%# things he did over and over again. And doubting if is he truly being sincere or just simply cunning?

Am i needing something to step up something for myself too so then maybe i can be respected?

Many thanks!

4724,When did the person I am become not what he wants?!,"Here I am again - this subreddit always brings me peace.  
For more context you can read my last 3 posts.  

It’s been almost 4 weeks since D-Day and today was hard because he still has days he thinks about not being with me.  Which I know is normal.  

He was having a “sulky” day and that triggers me so much.  

He says he cheated because he was unhappy, and had been unhappy for over a year.  But in that years time, anytime he was sulking, I would beg him to tell me what was wrong and he wouldn’t.  It turns out that all those times, he was thinking about life without me. 
 
Anyways - my theory is that he never wanted to tell me what was wrong because he never wanted to fix it.  And he didn’t want to fix it, because he knew that would mean giving up drinking and drugs (I know, this is out of left field but it’s ultimately where my resentment grew and why he started to detach from me)

Since D day, we have had a lot of emotional days, have spent a lot of time together and things have been really good overall.  We have sex pretty often where before we weren’t at all.  

Today I badgered it out of him why he was sulking and I wish I didn’t. 
He still thinks about AP, and just being with someone completely different than me.  
WHYYYYY
When did I become not enough? 
When did the person I am become not what he wants?! 
It’s so painful.

4737,Stbx husband said he never loved me and was using me all 6 years of our marriage,"The story of me and My cheating ex husband was he was visiting Canada from the USA when I met him. He took me on several dates and I was definitely crazy about him. I wanted us to be together and expressed how I even wanted to marry him (crazy I know) but he told me he still wasn't over an ex girlfriend so I told him to take time to get over that pain and hopefully when your healed we could try again. 

So for four months we went our seperate ways but still communicated as friends online. One day he told me he wanted to try to be with me (conveniently after I got a boob job) and was thinking of visiting Canada for three months on than three months off so we could be together.

 I agreed to the plan shortly after we ended up going on a trip to Vegas together and our feelings grew stronger and he brought up the idea of us getting married so we could be together all the time. I agreed and we ended up getting married instead completely abandoning the previous plan. 

Our first 6 months together was hell. We truly didn't know each other as well as we thought but we ended up getting better relationship wise. Until I found out that he had paid a prostitute for services behind my back. I tried to forgive him but his cheating never stopped. Constantly having emotional affairs with online women,holding on to nudes of exs. He even gave me 33k not to leave him which I used to fund my plastic surgery thinking if I was more beautiful he wouldn't cheat. 

I stayed with him due to insecurity,low self esteem and codependency. Our relationship seemed to get better until I discovered he had kept photos of the woman he cheated on me with. My love for him died that day and I started to gain weight. Due to depression.

 He than called me a fat, stupid all kinds of awful names because of my weight gain while simultaneously having an emotional affair with a coworker. When I finally got the courage to demand a divorce. He stole back gifts he got for me. Told me he was happy I ended things because I was fat and unattractive and I was trash. Said he never loved me and was using me the whole time of our 6 year marriage for papers and cheaper rent.

He refused to even come out to see me and actually called the police on me and I didn’t find out until later that it was him that had called. I know now that it was a mistake to go but I was in so much shock after being discarded that I couldn’t think straight.

4746,I found out my boyfriend (30m) cheated on me (25f),"My boyfriend (30m) went to Japan a year ago, we’ve been dating for 1year and 6months now, I just found out that he went out with a woman during his stay there. I always had a gut feeling that he did saw someone during his stay there but just bushed it off because I didn't had proof. 2 months ago I was going through his house phone and I saw on his whatsapp that he had contacted a Japanese girl during his stay there, they saw each other 3 times during his stay. I confronted my boyfriend about this and he said that they only went out to eat at restaurants cause apparently ""she know better restaurants around the area""🙄 I asked how they met he said the first time he found her on whatsapp I asked him again the 2weeks ago he said they saw each other on the streets and he went to ask for her number. I asked him why would he cheat and go on a date with another girl (which is still not ok for me because we were already dating for 6 at that time) • and he replied he was horny and was in a whole different country. I keep overthinking that he had sex with her considering the fact that he is also really into Japanese culture and he can be really perverted at times, he keeps telling me that nothing happened between them other than going to restaurants.

Am I overthinking or is he telling the truth?😭

TL;DR: My boyfriend went to Japan a year ago and met up with a Japanese woman three times during his stay. Initially, he claimed they just went to restaurants because she knew good places to eat, but later admitted he met her through WhatsApp or randomly on the streets.

4752,Trapped in an abusive marriage,"Hi guys, I’m new to Reddit and I’m not sure if I’m using this right. 

So I have been trying to seek help on how to leave this abusive marriage. I have been with my husband for 5 years and we have had law enforcement get involved before. He did time and of course with any abusive relationship they know how to ease themselves in. These past few months things have gotten worse and I have been physically hurt and I do have proof of the altercations because of my ring cameras. 2 weeks ago things got scary for my own life. He threatened to kill himself if I left and he had a gun and to be honest I was terrified he would turn that gun on me. I have had to lie to my family about this abuse because they have been through so much with our past. I have had visible bruises and marks and have had to lie about how they happened. We have kids but he makes sure to never act like this in front of the kids. I don’t know where to go from here because I’m starting a new job this week and don’t have the resources to move. He spent my entire tax refund. So that just screwed me on moving. He has told me if I ever reported him to the police he would have people after me.

4758,Everyone says that I was doomed to an abusive marriage as I am obese,"Mt heart broke thousands of times before I decided to leave my husband's house and come back to my mom. The abuse started with lying and manipulating, gaslighting, extreme financial control and by the time I decided to leave, there were 2-3 incidents of physical abuse on me and my daughter.

More than everything, it was how he insulted me constantly - when we were alone and in public. While we were eating together and while we were having sex. I was very heartbroken.

But what hurts me the most that even after four years, my family and friends and my mom think that I was doomed to an abusive marriage because I was always overweight. To this day, they say (while sympathizing with me) that he married me because I was earning and he wanted my money. Why else would he marry me? 

He is fair and slim and can work hard. I am brown and obese and have depressive episodes. I was also more qualified and had a stable job when we married while he was job-hopping. I supported him for three years while he was getting his sisters married off and solving his family problems. I am more grounded and practical and polite and diplomatic when I need to be.

Of course he apologized and then it was all ok, he’s been overall nice to me since.   We obviously are sexually active because he’s my husband but I guess I don’t know if I can be sexually assaulted by my husband?

And I think it's important to get through the next stage -- when I actually leave -- with him paying more attention to how he is behaving.

I think the counseling itself is really good for me. It helped that I came in with a list of behaviours I'd noticed -- things about escalating conflict, minimizing my feelings and wants, etc -- and I didn't have to describe them for her, he just did them right in front of her. So the next session when I went through my list there were no surprises, although I laid out what happened which made me ask him to go to therapy and she said it was domestic violence.

But he's also really happy with her, and is now booking solo sessions with her closer than a week apart, which is detrimental to my finances. As with all of these things, I'm unsure if this is deliberate or just thoughtless.

Or find another job. Im tired of him being miserable and making me miserable. 

Husbands view of reality is so twisted. Hes so dramatic. He thinks everyone is after him. Everyone is against him. He cant take criticism even his boss telling him about a mistake means his boss is against him. 

He told me today if he quits he will not feel comfortable w me staying and working for the enemy. So that they can talk about him behind his back and say things to me to convince me to leave him. 

He said “you need to stand up for your husband. You are either for me or against me. If you are against me then we dont need to be together”. I have to choose this job, or him. 

Im so so so sad. I Cant stop crying. I relapsed on my self harm today. Its not fair. ITS NOT FAIR. I have been unemployed for 2 years. We have an 8mo old baby and I was needing to find a job. They didnt pay much but it made me feel good to get a job so quickly and be useful and get out of the house. And to be good at something again and not be infiltrated with nothing but cooking, cleaning and laundry and kids.

Could this get better?","I know no one can make this decision for me, but I’m grateful for the chance to share what is on my mind and perhaps hear of others’ experiences. 

In the past, my husband chronically verbally abused me and emotionally / psychologically abused me for 8 years. He also physically abused me in isolated incidents.  It took me a long time to recognise the verbal and emotional abuse, and when I did, I pointed it out and he began to change (slowly and with lots of boundary enforcing by me). I came out of a fog of abuse and slowly began to come back to life. I rethought my views on divorce and started thinking I would like a divorce.  He is finally saying he sees the light and wants change. I am not sure if I can ever really enjoy being married to him due to the past. We have good moments but he severely damaged my trust and harmed me as a person. He wants to try and is now trying to do all the things I longed for in the past. I feel numb towards him.

I wish I didn’t experience derealization and panic attacks. There’s nothing wrong with me for having them. For a while they were getting worse but I feel like I’ve gotten better lately due to finding coping mechanisms. I’m proud of myself.

Putting all of my actions in an evil light. Gas lighting me and then telling me I’m gaslighting you. How I will never be like the people in your family. 

I’m tired of being trapped. I can’t leave. I have no family. No money. No support. No friends. No credit.

I keep things at a bay for my son. I turn to a rock when my husband yells at me. The minute I react everything will be turned around on me and so I’ve learned to just not engage.

Resentments grew, he became verbally abusive, 
he would be “so sorry” and swear up and down “never again”.... 
yeah right , his cycles of abuse became shorter, more severe and more often. 
 
Divorce was final sept 2019. 

But he hasn’t stopped He has still been sending me awful threats, false accusations and a plethora of abusive texts.  Out of nowhere! He had one of his rants on me on Easter.  

2 days later , he has the nerve to come over here to pick our child up, (follow the Schedule, pull up ,child will be ready and will come out. )    no need to come to the door. 

Well he rings the door bell. 
I was on a work call.  I didn’t want him to enter. 

he just comes in, plops down on the couch, as he is all freaking out,......  he had his laptop open. 
This dude was now asking me to help do his taxes!  

He was all worked up about his stimulus check he had not got it, he “needed my help”. 
he also had the nerve to ask me for half of the child Stimulus payment! 

I made it clear he doesn’t help parent but MAYBE  10% of the schedule,  
I pay for everything, they sent the child payment to-the primary and for a reason.  
No I was not splitting it with him.

Divorce didn’t stop it. 
He also still does these things to me. 

Verbal assaults  then will start with “I still I love you, I wish we could still make this work” ,  
I find these things so incredibly mean manipulative and twisted.

4781,Currently in an abusive marriage,"This message Is coming from complete desperation and a cry for help. I have a 4 year old and a 20 month old with my husband of 7 years years. I got married at the age of 21 and he was 25. We started off dysfunctional. I would blame myself at times for spazzing out and feeling lost and confused because I was so young and I didn't recognize the emotional abuse. 

He would put me down by telling me I didn't make any money and lived off of him, which I did cuz I was in and out of jobs after I got pregnant with my son. 

I always focused on how to fix myself and be a better person for him. I worked throughout my second pregnancy and helped him with bills as well. I wanted to please him and make him happy but I kept messing up some how. I always blamed myself and promised that next time I will be better... until one day the abuse became apparent when he beat me, threw me around shoved me, threw things at me for about 45 mins, some of this happened Infront of my son. 

That's when I called the police, I packed my things and moved in with my parents. He tried 5 months to get us ( the children and I) to come back. He apologized nonstop but something inside me told me not to trust him, but then my mom was tired of us being around and saw how much he was trying so she pushed us to go back, to the point where she became very verbally abusive... at that point I felt living with him would be a better choice.

[Short version: I have casually started dating someone...but the feelings we have for each other are STRONG even if I can't fully admit it to myself or him yet. Technically, I am still married and tomorrow is/was my anniversary. I know I'm going to be a bit off...do I tell him if he asks?]

I downloaded a dating app out of curiosity and boredom. I was in a sexless marriage for so long that honestly, I wanted to get laid. 

I talked to a few people and quickly realized with COVID, I was not comfortable meeting people that were not being careful. Just getting to know someone through the app was fun though. Most conversations fizzled out which was completely fine with me because I am genuinely not looking for anything serious. 

Then...he happened. He is kind, ambitious, empathetic and RESPECTS BOUNDARIES! After talking with him for a bit, he asked me on a virtual date. I emotionally freaked! After a serious relationship for so long, I didn't understand what a date was and declined. Lol It sounds so silly now, but I have not dated since I was 18 so I didn't know what to expect. He took my explanation and gave me space. No explanations needed, he understood my decision and respected it. 

We didn't talk for a while and I found myself thinking about him and wanting to send him jokes and tidbits from my day...so I reached out. Since then we haven't gone a single day without talking. I've met up with him a few times and I am uncharacteristically comfortable around him. I even tried to seduce him day #1... He has been a perfect gentleman and I KNOW he wants to, if you know what I mean. ;-) He's the one wanting to take it slow. There is something about that, that makes me feel more comfortable and dare I say it? I feel safe with him. He has been gentle in his conversation and when he can tell I'm getting uncomfortable, he steps back graciously. 

We are just dating and are not exclusive which is what I want. He understands that I am not in a position to commit to anyone right now and he accepts it. He is not seeing anyone else right now. He's just a great guy from what I can tell. I have been 100% honest with him when it comes to where I am emotionally and he has been patient and kind.

I have always been a non confrontational person. I simply can’t deal with him any longer. It’s always something! 

He has been on this road to self betterment and congrats to him on that! Seriously! but he is not any nicer to me. His moods are even more unstable.

SECOND I just want a Normal day!!! I could go on and on about him.. he walked OUT on his good job, I work from my home office 40+ hours a week, while he has been NAPPING. Just to get off work and have him jump all over me about something totally insignificant and sometimes not even real! No joke.

but long story short, I feel like I have been damaged by him. I have never had to deal with this before so I don’t know how to rid myself of this extreme anger. (I was hurt.... now over time it’s pure anger). 

Do I go get some expensive therapy and council? Or what? I feel so upset and angry with him on so many levels and for so long now.

I just want this home to be a healthy happy place CONSISTENTLY. I am finding this to be impossible with him..

**Why strong women get abused - Working theory:**

Because we've gotten where we are by not giving up, by not backing down from a challenge. Because we believe we can have whatever we want; all we have to do is go after it, work hard, and keep improving ourselves. 

**And then to my specific situation**

* I came from an abusive home, so it's hard not to register abuse as normal although I have done a lot of therapy around that
* It didn't start abusive, the abuse increased gradually over time
* He say he was going to improve and would for about 6 months each time, which convinced me to stay because I saw improvement, then he'd go back to his old ways
* I have a fear of abandonment and thus am also hesitant to abandon anyone else
* He had the marriage counselors (we went through 3 of them) convinced that he was trying and that he was willing to change
* He'd literally follow me around yelling until I finally blew up at him and then he would blame it on me. I would be shocked at my own behavior because I don't show anger like that nor do I want to, so I'd believe his story that I was the problem
* I had a mental health crisis (really terrible insomnia from PTSD) not long after I moved in with him and so that gave him and me an easy thing to blame for our problems vs. his abuse",cannot be inferred,no,yes,no,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

4799,I got Reddit to anonymously share this because I can’t bring myself to share this in person to anyone other then a therapist,"I had just gotten married and I was hiding from a lot of people how abusive my marriage was.
Long story short I got really drunk at a friends wedding where I sortta verbally vomited on people at the wedding venting about my toxic marriage.
The next day my husband got into a fight with me and ended up hitting me in the head with a 6 pack of beer. I blacked out. Had to be rushed to hospital. 
That’s not the worst part.
None of my friends came to visit me or help me.
I noticed they all distanced themselves from me and I couldn’t understand why.
I was now separated living alone and trying to recover.
Turns out my husband had told my friends, my church and family I had inflicted my own wounds.
Somehow everyone believed him.
The truth eventually came to light but I never received an apology or empathy from my friends or church.
I was in school to become a licensed therapist.
I dropped out because I developed such severe anxiety and depression.
The saddest part is I desperately wanted my friends back and had literally no value for myself.
Now a few years later I still can’t handle being on social media.
I have found really healthy sane people but I have 
never been the same.
I don’t tell anyone this because I have so much shame and somehow still blame myself.
Even though I have the sanity, schooling and awareness that it isn’t my fault.
Even typing this scares me.
I think I might try to finish my degree I just now have horrific imposter syndrome.

4804,"What made you susceptible to the abusive relationship? What made you stay too long (if you did)? What have you learned, and how have you changed to improve your life going forward?","I believe I was susceptible bc my dad abused my mom and I grew up acclimated to a toxic household where we lived for the “breadcrumbs” of good moments. 

I also grew up fundamentalist Christian, and my culture does not believe in divorce and strongly believes in no sex prior to marriage. As such, once I realised my husband was abusive, I believed my only option was to stay and work on the marriage and be kind and submissive no matter how he treated me. I had given him my virginity, so according to my culture, that was like giving him my entire value. If I left, I would be a non-virgin divorcee and no one would want me. That was not something I was willing to admit to myself at the time, but if I am honest with myself, that was an underlying belief. The shame of a failed marriage felt almost worse than suffering more abuse. 

Now I am working through my beliefs and learning to stand up for myself. I have not left yet, but this is a major paradigm shift for me and I am getting there. I’m not willing to live for “breadcrumbs” and future faking and I don’t want my psychological and physical health to be destroyed by the abuse, for my children’s sake as well.

4808,Those that were negatively impacted by a financially abusive partner...did you get anything or ask for anything back when you left?,"So, my ex was financially abusive toward me during our engagement and marriage. By the time I left him, I had so much credit card debt and zero savings that I literally could not afford anything despite making good money at my job. I am currently still struggling to pay off my cards and get my credit score back (before we got engaged I had over $10,000 in savings and a 780 credit score, which was pretty good for a 22-year-old I thought). I'll admit I was stupid and let him take advantage of me sometimes, but he was also very manipulative and controlling so it's definitely not all my fault. I was in debt our entire marriage from our wedding, having paid both his rent and mine when he could not right out of college, him getting aggressive when I wouldn't pay for our honeymoon, and not contributing at all to our joint expenses each month. Throughout our separation, I even helped pay for his medical expenses, his healthcare, his car insurance, and his moving expenses. He knew I was living paycheck to paycheck and racking up debt with these things because I asked him to help several times (we both worked full-time and made roughly the same amount, 5K apart annually). Instead of helping, he did afford Doordash for every meal, a new 3D printer, model sets, lego sets, and new video games....recently since our divorce he has bought a house. Meanwhile, my credit won't even allow me to get an apartment. 

I know I am not the only one that's been through this. My question, I guess is, did y'all ever get anything back from your financial abuser? Did you include it in alimony payments or in any legal way or did they eventually decide to help out? I could amend our agreement to have him owe me legally, but I am worried he'll get an attorney to fight it (which I cannot afford and don't want to deal with right now). I have asked him for help, but it's to no avail. I am still paying off a credit card that has a balance that is entirely couples counseling bills...yet he always claimed I ""didn't try hard enough to make us work."" So, I am getting nowhere with him. If anyone has any advice or strategies that would be great. I still have a great job and make good money, so I guess it's just one day at a time for paying off debt.",cannot be inferred,no,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4809,An encounter with a stranger may have saved my life...,"I recently went full NC with my extremely abusive, meth addicted boyfriend (I've posted on here a few times if you're looking for backstory). On Saturday I finally changed my phone number after another one of his unhinged, rage-fueled tirades and I haven't heard from him since. 

I've been a mess and worried for him constantly. This has been so much harder than I ever anticipated, and I keep cycling between feeling relieved and empowered, to guilty and ashamed. I promised him I'd love him unconditionally, and I feel like I failed him.

Last night at work, I was really feeling horrible and was planning on reaching out to him and breaking NC as soon as my shift ended. I'm a waitress at a local family owned restaurant, and I was close to tears all night at work. Towards the end of the night, an older couple in their 60s came in for dinner, but the husband didn't look well. He excused himself to wait in the car while his wife finished her dinner. I expected her to eat quickly and rush out to take her husband home. Instead she relaxed, ordered a beer and took her time. They were my only table at this point, and she was a little tipsy so she started talking. 

Turns out her husband was undergoing kidney dialysis, after a lifetime of drinking and uncontrolled diabetes. I told her I was sorry he was suffering, and she laughed. ""I'm not,"" she said, ""he's been making me suffer my whole life. And look who's still taking care of him.""

She went on to describe a 40 year marriage full of physical violence and emotional abuse. He beat her, cheated on her, had other children outside of their marriage - and she stayed with him through all of it. She was obviously angry and bitter, and commented several times that she should have left him decades ago. I told her a little bit about me, and what I was going through, and she hugged me, and told me not to end up like her one day. There's a lot more, but I'm crying typing this. You get the idea.

I came home from work last night, showered and went to bed. I didn't call him. I didn't call him this morning when I woke up, either. I called a therapy center instead, that focuses on EMDR, and they're going to help me set up a payment plan. I want to get better, I NEED to get better. And going back to him isn't going to help me be who I want to be. 

I feel pretty strongly that that woman saved my life last night. I hope everyone out there is doing well, staying strong, and choosing themselves today.

4826,Do you have trouble remembering?,"I have started writing my story.  I might one day post or publish it somewhere, but for now and the foreseeable future, it's just a private account of my experience.  

&#x200B;

I have a lot of trouble remembering much more than a few specific incidents.  Even during my marriage, when my (very unsupportive) younger sister asked why I considered my marriage abusive, I had very few specific things to explain to her what was going on.   ""He yells at me all the time"" or ""He's full of so much rage"" were the closest I could get.   She would ask, but what does he actually SAY or DO? and I could never say--I simply didn't remember, even hours after an incident I could not say exactly why his actions were so horrendous.

&#x200B;

I've been away from him for almost 7 years now, and it's mostly still hazy.

&#x200B;

I've done a bit of therapy concerning my marriage, and was told that having a jigsaw puzzle of memories in my head is not uncommon, but that in order to deal with trauma, part of my therapy will involve filling in the missing pieces so that I can form a complete memory in order to fully deal with it.

&#x200B;

I'm currently trying to find an affordable therapist to deal with this, and I don't even want to remember much more than I do until I have someone safe to process it with, but I just wonder how common this issue of forgetting is among those of us who have been through long term abuse?

4836,New domestic violence victim,"My husband has been physically hurting me and threatening me for the past year. We are both very young. He bites me, hits me occasionally, pulls my hair, squeezes my wrist super tight and pins me down so hard that I can’t breathe well. The thing is he’s never made me bleed or bruised me very badly, yet it always really hurts. I know what I’m dealing with is so minor to other domestic violence stories. I guess I’m just nervous because it’s our first year of marriage and I’m afraid it could get worse as the marriage progresses. 

I tried researching things about domestic violence but nothing assured me at all. I have so many questions. What happens to a victim after they report their abusive spouse to the police? Are they separated from their spouse? Would court happen? Will my husband now struggle to find a job so it would only make it harder for us both?  He’s in the army reserves. Would he be discharged or would he just get the equivalent to a slap on the wrist? Will I actually feel safer or is it not worth the headache?

I would provide video documentation to the police. I’m just terribly worried that I’ll regret even telling the police... that it will somehow backfire on me or just lead to a lot of tension from his family. I wonder if I should just wait to see if it gets worse and then report it.

I could see that he’s getting frustrated at my behaviour with my mum. I was feeding my son and FaceTiming him and she asked me if she could feed him and I said no because I just wanted him to bed fed and back to sleep. He gets too stimulated if my mum talks to her

I know the kids and I are better off if Nex and I divorce but I didn't want to file until I got situated better financially (does that make me a sh*tty human being?). 

I've been married for over 12 years with 3 kiddos (youngest is an infant) and have been a SAHM for all but the first few months of marriage. At one point I started a business but I never really got it off the ground because NEX said I need to wait until all of the kiddos are in school. Surely, I'd be a bad wife if I didn't support my family, right? Riiiiiight. Well, now I have no real career and no real way to support myself or my kids. Hindsight is 20/20, right? Moving forward.. I've been making a few moves towards earning an income but nowhere near being able to support myself or my kiddos. 

Anyway, Nex served me with papers a week ago. It hit a lot harder than I thought it would. Just the fact that he did it hurt. Then I read what he wants in the temporary orders and it got a whole lot worse. Nex wants 50/50 custody, requested that he pay $0 child support, $0 alimony, $0 for utilities, $0 for food. He'll pay the mortgage, my car note and minimums on my credit cards. The credit card offer is an extra slap in the face. I've had to charge all of my expenses, groceries, diapers, etc. for the last 6 months because he emptied our joint checking and transferred his paychecks to his personal account. He's pressuring me hard core to sign the temporary orders (no, I'm NOT signing). Nex wants to sit down and for me to come to an agreement (his words) to avoid this going to a judge.

I asked for a separation in November 2019 and due to finances can’t move out. I have no family here and a small circle of friends that are mostly wives of his friends. He works for his parents in a self employed situation.

I have been waiting for him to submit his financial disclosure since February. COVID hit and now I’m stuck home with him passing snide comments and harassing me about how my leaving is a black mark against my kids and my family. He drinks every night almost and sleeps all day while I struggle to keep the kids occupied and work. We finally got his disclosure, not finalized,definitely not complete, today.  It looks like there will be more legal costs and arguing through lawyers before we even get to a glimpse of an agreement.

I’m so frustrated and scared. I just want to take my kids and leave but I can’t because of the finances. I just don’t understand why he keeps on stringing me along all the while claiming he wants me to move out one day and telling me he will follow me and when I leave the next.

4864,I AM FREE,"My final divorce hearing was today. We did not have any children together and the only asset that needed to be divided was the home that he has been living in for the past ten months.

The hearing was scheduled for only one hour and I was so nervous he was going to pull some of his narc garbage and get it continued. It was a web hearing because of covid and we all sign on and the hearing starts. 

Well anytime he could speak he starts spewing his narc garbage about how horrible of a person I was for leaving him “high and dry with nothing”. The judge mentions that he has been living in the marital home for ten months with me paying for half of it. He then starts crying saying the only reason why he stayed in the home was because he thought I was going to come back. He made himself look ridiculous! 

My lawyer got me compensated for the interest that I paid on the mortgage for the last ten months and we were also able to prove all the debt was marital. My nex kept saying that the debt wasn’t his. When the judge asked him to provide evidence he said “I’m sorry your honor, I did not prepare anything for today.” And the debt will be settled with the sale of the home. Boom. 

The hearing was an hour, I legally have my name restored, and the divorce decree was sent to me 15 minutes after the hearing. It happened so fast I was just shaking and crying when we got off the call. 

I’m worried about if he’s physically going to lash out at me now because he truly suffered a terrible narcissistic injury today. 

One foot in front of the other one is all I kept saying to myself when I fled for my life almost a year ago now. DO NOT GIVE UP. These narcs think their ridiculous delusions are reality but once they have to back it up they just can’t.

At the time we had been separated for 9 months, but we had not filed for divorce. He played the pitty card about how he was broke and could we wait to hire a mediator once he saved some money.  At the end of this situation he angerly yelled at me....Im not talking to you about any of this anymore.  Were going to do this the hard way.  I'm going to hire a lawyer and were going to court!  This was followed by threats of taking my house away if I didn't make our kids see him.  And that up until this point he had been working so hard to make this process easy on everyone, but now that's over and he is going to make this so hard for me....thats a whole nother post in its self.

Well, I called his bluff.  In Febuary I hired a lawyer and filed for Divorce on Feb. 27th.  He was served papers on March 13th.  Monday, May 4th, he was ruled to be in default because he had not responded to the divorce petition!  

Here is what happens in my state if you default:

""The responding spouse needs to file an answer with the court within the deadline. ... When a spouse doesn't respond to a divorce petition, the person who failed to file the answer to the court will lose his or her rights to make arguments about property division, support, and child custody.""

Thats right folks.  He lost his voice in our divorce.  I can go to the court and ask for what ever I want and he can't say one damn thing about it.  I know he thinks I am still under his thumb.  That he can push my buttons and have me do his bidding. I think thats why he didn't bother to file. He expects that he is going to tell me what he wants, and I will make it happen for him.

4867,Finally Had to Force Communication Through Attorneys,"My ex has been absolutely miserable since I moved about a year and a half ago. He managed to get my daughter to be his little spy in my home and she “reports” every move I make. I get emails filled with false accusations or demands that I do things differently to questions about how I do thinks at my house. 

Since the pandemic started and our state went into a stay at home order, he and his attorney have both accused me of making too many trips out of the house. They “remind” me that I am only to leave for essential shopping. 

It’s exhausting. I can’t move on or live my life when I am STILL reconsidering every move to choose the one that will be less likely to make him freak out. I spent our 17-year marriage doing this. 

This past week has been no different, and the emails and texts are escalating because he didn’t get what he wanted (he refused to exchange custody or the kids for a week past when I should have gotten them, citing the pandemic for now logical reason other than to gain control). My lawyer has been pointing out his controlling and aggravating behavior yet it continues. 

It has gotten so bad that I had to change the text alert tone on my phone for just him because every time a text came in I was filled with anxiety wondering what he was mad about now. I lived this life for 20+ years with him, I’m divorcing him for a reason. I want my life back. I’m tired of living in fear. 

A few days ago he called the police to my house again. This time he accused my home of being unlivable (the officer knew exactly what this was and was in and out of my house within 2 minutes because my home may not be spotless but it’s certainly not in unlivable conditions). I was forced to allow a stranger, an essential employee, into my home during a pandemic. My lawyer was done. I’m done. We told his attorney the same. 

Now he has to either choose a coparenting app (which I’ve requested multiple times and he’s always refused) or all communication must be done between attorneys. It’s a pain in the ass for me, but it’s worth it.

Yesterday he contacted me via attorneys about something he would have usually texted or emailed me about. Is this actually going to work? Can I actually breathe a little easier? Will I no longer dread hearing his text tone and seeing his emails pop up on my phone? Can I finally get some peace?

4869,"First post, could use some support (long)","Long story short: XH initiated the divorce after 18 years of marriage and two kids. We have been divorced about 4 years, he has remarried. We have 50/50 custody of our two teen kids (alternating weeks), but since August of last year our son has lived with me full time. XH thought it would be “more stable” but I believe his new wife couldn’t handle his issues (teenager, ADD, ASD). For the most part things are okay, but we have had some issues. 

Things have really ramped up with COVID19 (of course). XH and I talked and decided going between houses would be more dangerous for our daughter. He agreed she should stay at my home for the time being. He and new wife can both work from home. My job allowed me a week off, with the possibility of more as needed. I’m a private nanny any my bosses are both essential workers (mental health). They are thankfully able to work from home and have been staying home as much as possible. Our plan is to have me work for them until a mutually agreed upon time or if our state bans all movement. We have also agreed to respectively take temps of the people in our homes and notify if there are symptoms present. I feel I am just as much a threat to them as they are to me.

Anyway, XH is now pressuring me to stay home. He has tried to guilt me, threaten me, but I’m doing my best to grey rock him. Last night his new wife looked up my boss on Facebook and messaged her it was “urgent”. When my boss called her (thinking there was a medical emergency with me), new wife demanded to know details of my employment, what measures we had in place (info I had already shared), and tried to pressure my boss into either firing me or giving me extended time off.

I am livid. I have never shared my employer’s names with XH or NW. I would never dream of calling their places of employment to demand personal info. I’m embarrassed that my boss had to deal with that. It makes me look unprofessional. I have not confronted XH or NW yet. I am calling my lawyer on my break today to discuss if I should take action.

4870,I just want off of this damn rollercoaster!,"My STBXH has been emotionally abusive and refused to spend time with me (he is a PC gaming addict) our entire 4 year marriage. When I asked for a divorce, he agreed and was dating two days later. I was heartbroken that he didn't want to work on fixing things and had moved on so quickly, but started going to therapy and was healing. During our separation, he's been very sparkly and I was hoovered into sleeping with him in a moment of doubt. After that, I knew with all my heart that he is a narcissist and only cares about himself and used me. So I was back to being upset again. Now he is finally moving out tomorrow after a month of living together while being separated! I was over the moon happy, thinking I can finally start grieving and healing in private. But of course today he tried to hover me again (he's been working out) to get me to agree to waive him paying child support in the divorce settlement. Hes said before he would agree to certain terms, and then when I agree, have the settlement drafted and sent, he refuses to sign. He keeps wanting more and more, saying it's not ""fair"". I'm not backing down about the child support amount any more.  But now we have to go to court to let a judge decide and I have to spend more money for my lawyer and more time dragging this out. I just want off this damn ride! I'm tired of the ups and downs and just want to be left alone. Im not going to give up, but I'm already so tired, I just want all of this behind me and to move on.",yes,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4871,It’s done!,"He signed the papers! I had to come way down on the child support amount but was able to hold firm at my bottom most amount. I have primary custody, I’m fine with the visitation schedule (he cancels all the time and doesn’t take advantage of make ups ever and I’m fine with that. I had to make a few very minor concessions but he finally backed down. I’m 99% sure it’s because he can’t afford his lawyer anymore and his lawyer is sick of his nonsense. This is where I insert a shrug emoji if I knew how. 

Either way, the papers are signed. I’ll have to coparent with him until he decides that being number one dad isn’t getting him the attention he wants and moves on to something else. Now to rebuild my life.

Update: thank you for the congrats! My nex is now harassing me by text about how I ruined our marriage and this is all my fault and by trying to be amicable with him but not be his friend I clearly don’t want what’s best for our child.

4872,Now he wants a paternity test for our daughter!,"This is some what of an update on my previous post about the child support meeting, can't link post on mobile.

He received his copies of the child support order and was questioning why there wasn't an AOP for our daughter. We weren't married when we had our son and he signed one for him, by the time our daughter came we were married, so he is the legally presumed father. But he wants a paternity test on her. He really believes that I cheated throughout our marriage. And him questioning him being her biological father makes me sick to my stomach.

I had quit my job and was taking care of our home and son full time when we decided to try for a second child. In the past, before and during discarding, he would bring up a neighbor of ours that he accused me of sleeping with. The funny thing is is I never really interacted with this neighbor. My Nex was the one who hung out with this neighbor. But of course now that I'm out of the fog I see this accusation as another one of his projections. He was probably cheating on me at that time so of course he would assume that I was as well.

I have no problem with doing a paternity test on either child, they are his. The only thing keeping me from spiraling into sadness about this right now is once it's done, and the tests come back saying he is the father, he can't play the ""she cheated on me throughout our whole marriage"" card. But then again he will probably say that I'm just that stealthy that I made sure not to be fucking around when we were trying to conceive our second child.

4873,Having a hard time coping lately,"I've totally sucked at the grey rock / no contact stuff lately.

For some background, at the beginning of my divorce, I had a family member willing to take me in for a year so I could get back on my feet.  I'm a little over halfway through that grace period now.

I've improved in a lot of ways since that started but I'm still unemployed, and my expenses are starting to pile up in a way that is making finding a job soon very necessary.  I've delayed in part because once I move again at the end of the year I'll be in a new city and I don't want to deal with the logistics of commuting until then.  But also everything I've been through has completely shattered my self confidence.  The thought of having to go and sell myself to strangers in an interview gives me so much anxiety I could puke.  I was a stay at home mom when my marriage ended.  I always knew restarting my career one day would be tough, but I thought I'd be doing it without money pressures and with the support of a spouse. Now I have to take care of my kids pretty much on my own and I don't even get alimony.  My STBEXH got to stay in the same city, keep his job, and generally didn't have to uproot his entire life like the kids and I did.

Also, the lack of sex and lack of privacy in my current living situation is wearing on me now that it's been half a year.

So that whole situation has me feeling very irritable.

My STBEXH is going though a phase where he's pretending he's sorry and wants to be better.  But his compliments and apologies just grate on me SO MUCH and I lash out.  I'm sure our text messages lately make \*me\* seem crazy because he's hoovering so hard and I'm just being mean to him.  But, seriously, his amends fall so short.  He knows I'm short on money so he does things like offer to give me money to go out to dinner.  But does he pay any of the kids expenses?  Does he pay for the medication for his own dog he abandoned with me?  No, that's somehow all on me even though I don't have a job.

Once I get a job I'll be in a better position so I should focus on doing that.  I know it's a waste to try to get him to understand even a fraction of the harm he's caused. But I'm hurting and just can't seem to stop trying to reason him into having actual remorse.",yes,no,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4874,New to Reddit and new to divorcing a narc,"Edited to remove location. 
First post.  Super new in this process.  Long story short, he has cheated, lied, been caught inappropriately groping people and texting others.  Just now seeing it for what it is.  We tried a joint petition for divorce, but he was, of course manipulative and sees no need for me to look at his retirement etc.  We have two small children.  I work 15 hours a week to be with them.  I am a great mother. Even he knows this. Praises me on social media. Today he learned I filed a petition for divorce. I knew it would get ugly. He says I’m responsible for all of this, the kids will be hurt by this, asked how I’m paying my attorney, and the kicker, says he will now go for full custody of the kids.  Prior to knowing I filed, he was proposing I get full physical and he will just do visits.  I know he’s trying to get to me and I shouldn’t react.  But holy hell this is hard!! I’m so scared of what he is capable of saying and doing to hurt me.  He wasn’t honest in our marriage.  Shouldn’t expect him to be honest now.  But you’d think he would have a tiny bit of respect for me. I have to stop thinking he’s going to be rational, right? Also he’s a lawyer. And not for family law.  He’s a know-it-all but is so clueless about this.  I dread the months (years?!) to come.

4875,Financial abuse,"My ex and I were married for almost 20 years. He made me feel stupid when it came to finances, paying bills, saving money, etc. He once cut up my debit card in front of me as punishment for using our joint checking account to buy a $12 lunch when he told me only to use it in an emergency. I felt stuck. I have two degrees and I worked throughout the marriage but never felt like his equal. His job was more important than mine because he made significantly more than me and his salary paid the majority of our bills. He has a degree in economics and we were in almost $90k of credit card debt. I quit my job, cashed in my 401k and paid off a huge chunk, but he used most of it to pay off bills only in his name. I finally left him and he tried to ruin me in many ways, especially financially. Dragged our case out for almost two years over maintenance and support. It got ugly at times but I prevailed. I was left with over $30k in credit card debt between my own from our marriage and debt incurred after to pay for the divorce. He is required to give me a portion of his stock shares and bonuses through his job and I’m using that money to pay off my debt. I had my taxes done recently and learned he’s been incorrectly claiming our children’s private school tuition as a child care credit. I also learned he owes almost $15k in taxes while I received a nice refund. They also gave him vouchers to start prepaying his estimated taxes for this year for almost $21k. I get half of his 401k in a few months, which I will take a loan against to pay off the remainder of my debt. Being away from him and seeing clearly how much he financially manipulated and controlled me has given me new life. I vow to never get into that position again, make smarter choices and be grateful I’m free of someone who had no fucking clue what he was doing with our money.

4877,"Financial ruin post divorce, continued","I am so mad that I endured decades of abuse for the sake of keeping the “intact family” and out of financial fear, yet I am going bankrupt and have little clue how to manage money after giving up control of that to NexH. His economic stewardship included freaking out at me over grocery bills, while spending tons on travel with his family and on his own dissipated solo travel, fully supporting some of his family members, and gambling (both through day trading and online gambling). Yet I had what I wanted materially and didn’t have to worry about paying basic bills, cutting services, etc like I am now. He’d always tell me I was naive and couldn’t support the lifestyle I wanted as a single mom, and that’s a big part of what kept me trapped for so long. And now I still feel mentally trapped by the thought that maybe I can’t do this myself, long term. I spent a ton on self care (hotels, concerts, retail therapy) after the divorce, it wasn’t right, it reflected me feeling completely out of my mind after the marriage ended. Then had unexpected medical bills (all mental health care related after the divorce) and of course, legal bills. He pays the minimal child support he is obligated to pay, and ignores the (non-enforceable according to my attorney) “extraordinary expenses” part of the divorce decree. It’s hard not to feel at times like he was right, like I should’ve sucked it up even more and stayed.

4887,It’s our anniversary...,"Ten years married, twenty together. We’re only still married because we have to live together due to finances, and I refuse to divorce him until I’m done with school. (My name isn’t on the house, he made sure of that when it was given to us two years ago.)  Anyhow, after several years of abuse, we decided to divorce. Of course he pulled the Narc stuff, love bombing then blaming or plain ignoring me, back to love bombing and wanting another shot at marriage, then within hours (mind you, no arguments happened) he said “Yeah, I can’t do this, I’m out, I want a divorce as soon as possible.” So, I finally emotionally untangled myself. I was hoping today wouldn’t come, that somehow the calendar would just skip today. I didn’t know what was going to happen, which is how I spent most of my years with him. I didn’t know who I was going to see this morning or what kind of attitude he was going to have.  He wished me a happy anniversary and said he had a present for me. I said ‘happy anniversary’  to him, I was shocked, and said that I needed to get to school. The present, whatever. The card said I’m going to be a great (my degree) and that he’s proud of me. More kind words in one card than hes said in years. (Truly nice, I mean. He frequently made those comments that came with an insult. “It’s really sweet that you truly believe you didn’t do anything wrong. You’re so cute and naive.” ) I didn’t get him anything, and I told him that. He seemed insulted, of course, we know how sensitive these covert narcs can be. I’m not going to cave, though. I’m not sorry. I didn’t do anything wrong. People who are divorced or planning to get divorced do not celebrate their wedding anniversary. He made the choice to get me something, not me. I just did what normal divorcing couples do, and tried to let it go. I’m sure within a week or so this is going to bite me in the ass somehow, he’s great with the narcissistic sneak attacks, but for now, I’m proud that I didn’t do what I used to and feel bad or guilty, and that I didn’t cave and get sucked back into this cycle.

They were never used for housing or living expenses, because all of the bills come out of the joint account. I have no idea how much money is hidden, how it is he wracked up so much credit card debt, and apparently he’s been cheating on our taxes for years. When we first got together we were young. Once he started doing the taxes jointly, I just signed and let him handle it. When he said he needed to ‘show more money’ or ‘show less money’ I figured it needed to even out with the business accounts, that he needed to reconcile better. I just recently found out through a counselor what it means. I’m terrified of what all this means. I have no income, no decent education (being cut off from everything in my marriage), two kids (one of which was abused by him as well) and no where to go.

Ive posted on here quite a few times about my evolving situatio, I left 2 months ago with our 2 kids, got a PFA, went to a domestic violence shelter for a month then into an apt I’m renting. Tons of help from my family. Kids happier. Filed for divorce right after I left and since it didn’t work out with him contacting my 3rd party to see the kids... I.e like 20-30 + crazy texts/emails/calls a day to my dad begging me to come back, my lawyer and his lawyer moved us to Our Family Wizard and, while we are using it to coordinate the kids. We managed to come up with a decent agreement with who has the kids when. Our lawyers agreed with it. My soon to be ex husband literally refuses to move on.  On 3 different occasions I wrote long arse messages on OFW explaining very much in depth why I left, recalling the abuse, lies, Mistrust, the pain and our general dysfunctional marriage. I’ve urged us to work together to co-parent effectively. Basically trying to make it work between us for the sake of our kids and I always prayed he’ll write back “ok I understand” or “yea, I’ll back off and give you space” instead I get groveling, begging, that he’s changed, that my leaving has changed him, that the kids need an intact family, etc, etc. ok I left in 2017 for a month and when I came back absolutely nothing had changed. I’ve resolved not to go back this time and frankly our kids are happier and less stressed out since they aren’t around incessant dysfunction. But he just doesn’t stop! I’m developing panic attacks, stomach aches and chest pain just thinking of him or checking Our Family Wizard. Basically my sympathetic nervous system is on over drive. Im afraid I’m going to end up getting severely ill from the stress. Im an RN as well and need to return to work but keep extending my leave because how can I be expected to properly focus on my patients when he’s stressing me out like this! Also this whole thing has stressed my parents and aunt our really really badly and they kind of can’t handle any more of this related stress either and are stepping back before their health suffers. The kids and I are in therapy but it’s no magic bullet. I’ve told my lawyer, he’s told his lawyer... they’ve read the OFW messages and my lawyer has told me to just ignore them but how can I?!?!?!!

4892,Is this parental alienation?,"After a nervous breakdown last fall, I began to realize that everything was NOT MY FAULT, and I was suffering from very strange symptoms that my husband convinced me were related to my mental illness (depression).  As it turns out, I had a nervous breakdown due to CPTSD from the abuse I suffered in my marriage. I was finally ready to talk about it, and finally realized that one of my children and myself were victims of covert narcissistic abuse.  My daughter is older, and we’ve begun to talk about it. She now understands that she did nothing wrong, that her father has personality and control disorders. We frequently discuss how we feel, and what we’ve been through, the behavior that scared and scarred us, and how our behaviors have changed. I remind her that her father isn’t a bad person, he is the man we loved, but he is also another man, too. Her therapist is very supportive of this, and encourages our little “support group”, especially since we see him one way, and everyone else sees him another. It’s like battling with a ghost, it’s hard for anyone to believe because only two of us see it. So, is what I’m doing alienation? I don’t want to take any chances that the judge will think so, and allow my kids to live with someone who is abusive, or think that I’m abusive for doing this. This is good for her though, and for me. We both feel much the same way, and we’re not suffering (emotionally and physically) like we were before we started opening up. I’m terrified.

4901,What has worked for me (so far),"I've been able to navigate a no fault divorce and custody without court, gaining 100% custody and supervised visitation for him. My strategy has been to record every conversation and interaction. I documented every offense that illustrates how abusive he can be. Then when I was ready to file I presented him with the document and told him that I had all of the evidence to support my claims. I told him that my lawyer had advised a restraining order, as well as civil suits for slander and harassment. 

I let him listen to just one of the recordings but did not allow him to have a copy of anything or see all of the evidence and kept multiple copies in secure locations. 

I stood my ground, refusing to sign any agreements he drafted and told him that if continued to pressure me about it I would get a restraining order for harassment. Of course I was afraid to look like the unreasonable one at times but during all of this I contuinued therapy to reassure myself that I wasn't being too drastic and keeping a grip on who I really am. I know the instinct of a normal person is to de-escalate the situation but I can't forget how manipulative and volitile my nex can be just because he's now smiling in my face.

Beyond that our parenting plan stipulates that any breach in civility in front of the kids will terminate that visitation. Aside from that I completely ignore his presence when he visits the kids..

4908,I think I’m being taken advantage of,"I want to start with some backstory.  My siblings and I were homeschooled and not allowed to do a lot of fun things.  We oldest two were especially denied fun and basic rites of passage like going to prom.  We all suffered intense narcissistic abuse.  Constant screaming, cussing, name-calling and physical abuse.

My reason for the backstory is because I struggle with finding a decent spouse and feel like I don’t know what a normal relationship is or how to acquire one.  I’m an older millennial female and my brother born right after me is also very socially awkward and has hardly dated.

I got married relatively recently.  This is not my first marriage or his, but our histories are long stories I don’t wish to get into at this moment.  It now seems my husband is not who he portrayed himself to be.  I make proportionally way more money than he does which has always bothered me, but I had this worry about being alone.  He told me he would try to handle most of our living and put the majority of my money in savings.  I now found out he has told bald-faced lies about money and fundamental moral issues.

My husband had asked me for money to help out an immediate family member he claimed was struggling, but I found out months later that was a lie and they never received it.  He chooses to work few hours at a low-paying job and then I have to pick up the slack.  He got very few hours in the summer and instead of choosing to get another job he asked me to help pay back child support for kids who have been adults for years.  I paid for a long road trip for Christmas 2023 during which he was verbally abusive and didn’t let me make most of the important decisions.  It was my car in my name only, my auto insurance, I paid for the gas, and I paid for all the hotels and nearly all our fast food and groceries.  Also since I had to pay for the hotels it was me who had to get out of the car late at night with unsavory characters lurking about.  He wants to be in charge like Andrew Tate with zero of the provision and protection.

My husband claimed he was this loving father who never abused his kids but I found out that was far from the truth and that he was abusive.  I actually thought his story made no sense since he has such a violent temper with me.  I also found out he bragged about how stupid I was and how he was going to get me to pay all his back child support, a five digit number, and was hoping for us to get divorced and him take half my stuff.",no,yes,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
4914,Navigating the System,"The dehumanization and glib attitude is a cancer to the system. 

I am a victim of domestic violence, my husband is the abuser. I have done EVERYTHING I can to get safe in my county.

I started with the DV hotline. I was waiting for two hours before I called it quits. 

I called every single one of the DV advocate programs in my county (5 total) asking for a bed for me and my service animal. I was ready told that they don’t accept pets or service animals and that they can’t help me. 

I then went to legal Aid. They can’t help me get representation for divorce or DV  because there are no services in my county. Legal Aid told me to call DV shelters and ask again and remind them of the ADA (Americans with Disability Act). 

I call every DV shelter again. Some shelters out right said they won’t have beds for the foreseeable future. 

One shelter told me that I was rude after telling them about the ADA and my rights and they reserve the right to not house me at any point. 

I called Legal Aide, was told to keep trying. 

I called the last shelter and the man wouldn’t even let me finish my sentence. I was told that they don’t have to house my service animal and that he wants to speak with my lawyer. 

I called legal Aid. Again. They told me to get an order of protection.

 I did my research, called the appropriate people, and if I go this route, I will lose my rental assistance because I wouldn’t have any income (financial abuse is a major part of my marriage). DSS has like a six month wait list for any assistance. 

I called legal aid. I was told that they can’t help me because I exhausted the resources available in the county. 

I am surviving an abusive marriage, and the places that are meant to help only demonized me   

My choice is stay in an abusive marriage just to have food on the table and a roof over my head and to keep my service animal 

Or

Get a protective order and lose my housing and my belongings and wait for the government to have the time to help 

Or 

Go to a DV shelter, lose my service animal, lose everything I have and risk forfeiting my vehicle because it’s an asset. 



All of this is so messed up. But I guess I have to stay and deal with it while these people tell me to stay strong and kick rocks🙃

4916,Trauma dumping early red flag?,"I’m a 1 year out of a 10 year long emotionally abusive relationship with my kids dad. I met a really amazing woman and we have sooo much in common, our daughters have the same name and it’s not a common name (my kid is 5, hers is 12) we drive the same car, we have the same/ mostly similar hobbies, have similar taste in music, and want the same things ultimately out of life except for lifestyles are completely different, I am pretty health conscious and had a sustainable permaculture farm with my ex and she eats garbage processed foods which is a big deal for me. It is the complete the opposite of my ex we had lifestyle in common and nothing else. The kicker is she is 6 months out of a 10 year long abusive marriage also.  We are definitely different enough that it’s not like dating myself but we seem to think really similar. She also is a single mom so we had bonded on that. She actually loves kids and wants to do things with the kids which their dad didn’t want anything to do with the kids. We have only known each other each for about an about month a decided to start dating, and it worries me that it’s all love bombing a future faking. I also worry since we are both out of long term abusive relationships and have been immensely trauma dumping on each other about how bad are ex’s fucked us up, its not sustainable. I’m also scared to trust someone again and so is she. It’s been intensely truly intimate super quickly like I’ve never found with another partner. It has not been superficial in any way,
really deep, really quickly. I like who I’m around her and being with her. I can’t help feeling, I’m jumping into another trauma bond or is this sound like the real deal?

4917,Almost two months since my fiance left me married someone else behind me back all in two weeks,"He’s in jail for dv on BOTH of us. He came back after they got into a fight I let him just stay with me until he got drunk and strangled me she bailed him out he did it to her but the abuse was worse from police report 

I am still trying to accept all of this. The cheating. The marriage. He relapsed on booze after 5 years sober I’ve never seen him drink he was physically abusive many many many times sober but the cheating thing is all new. 
It’s so painful. It’s been almost 6 weeks no contact 

I am moving on surely but slowly. 
Knowing he’s in jail and he can’t contact me helps. But it’s so painful I don’t even know who he is. Four years I spent every night and morning with this person and the betrayal trauma of it all is so intense 
I have so many questions 
I wish I could write him a letter pouring my heart out on what he did to me. 
The nights my soul wept and the screams that came out of me are sounds I never heard before. 

But he doesn’t care. I know he doesn’t care. 
His brain is broken and blames me some how some way when all I’ve done is love him. I’ve only shown him love and loyalty 
And he cheated on me the last month of our relationship so horribly and just discarded me like I was trash on the side of the road 

I hope this pain just goes away one day
I’m nowhere ready to date. It’s too much. 
And my soul can’t handle the normal depths of dating. 

I miss parts of him. But I was miserable with him. I just will never understand how he did what he did to me 

I am sure he regrets it and has a lot of time to think in jail. His life collapsed after he cheated on me and left me for someone else thinking the grass is greener.

I am a little over a year past escaping my emotionally and sexually abusive marriage (yay) but I still struggle with C-PTSD and anxiety because for some reason, I have this doom-y feeling that he will show up at my house unannounced - he lives in a different state now but it’s a driveable distance. I hate that he knows where I live. I hate that it is the house we lived in together and the holes in the walls and knuckle prints on doors constantly haunt me. I changed the locks and have a security camera but still no peace of mind. 

But in one in a half months it will all be over! I am moving back to my home country, he won’t know my address and there will be an entire ocean between us. I am hopeful to finally have the opportunity to calm down and not be on edge the entire time. 
I also have an amazing guy waiting for me who is literally the calmest and mentally mature person I have ever met but now I’m afraid that a) it’s too good to be true, b) I’ll screw it up by self-sabotaging or c) I just get hurt again.

4927,Sad for new reasons,"This is not about my abusive ex at all. But I don’t feel like anyone else will understand why I am so devastated. Been single about a year, after divorcing my abusive ex. Life without him is AMAZING and I was having a blast being single just doing my thing.

I got on a dating app and met a guy, we had amazing chemistry and I was really excited to see him more, get to know him better, whatever. We’d only been on a few dates but the connection was strong. Then he told me he can’t see me at all, after we’d just decided to see only each other (because we wanted to have sex and we’re both old fashioned like that.) Well, he informed me that basically he’s not over his ex and thought he was ready to date but he isn’t. I get that. 

But it hurts. The FIRST person I thought I could trust, and I know it was only a few dates. But those few dates were better than my entire marriage ☹️. This is the part that I feel like only you guys will understand- it’s like I feel like I’m doomed. Will I ever get to see what a healthy relationship is like? I’m so sad.

4931,Husband lying/ financial infidelity,"Tl;dr: I (48f) have been married for 20 years to my husband (52m). First I want to say I had very low self- esteem and no balls to stand up for myself. Early in our marriage he told me he had ""a small loan"" which he didn't disclose. It was 5k which to me isn't ""small"". He drove without a license for 11 years despite my nagging him for years to renew it. I paid that fine and drove him 25 miles to and from work for 3 weeks till he could get the car back, baby in tow at 9pm. Then he drove with an expired registration that I reminded him to take care of several times, $400 fine. He has had 2 cars reposessed (one last month and one 10 years ago), his credit went down the toilet, as did mine, we lost our homeowners insurance because of it, and I found some online gaming debt along with hundreds in overdraft fees from his bank along with 5 credit cards (total about $15k) and 2 personal loans I didn't know about. And shame on me for believing him all the times he assured me he paid the car, the mortgage, etc. I keep finding out about more debt- yesterday he got a collections notice for a credit card he ""forgot"" he had. $1300. 😮‍💨 I told him I want a divorce and he first shut down, then reminded me that he forgave me after I had an emotional affair and an alcohol problem and asked how could I walk away so easily.  His financial irresponsibility has screwed us. He is making me feel like it is no big deal. Is he gaslighting me or am I overreacting?

4935,44 F 58 M Married,"
I am married to a narcissist. I realize I was groomed. I was only 19 years old and looking at being a single mom. I was so love bombed. He shaped me into what he told me was potential but all along the way he mocked, criticized and isolated me. I had self esteem issues and he always made me feel inferior. I ending up marrying him at 28  I was to young to know what real love was and had several children later. I want so bad to get out now, now that I endured all that I could take.  I used to feel so threatened, and afraid to leave him. He already used the courts to remove my rights as my children’s  mother, he forced me to retreat to his control and demands all on a court approved document. I ended up crawling back desperate not to permanently loose my children. The stories I could share of what I have been through would shock you. 
I look at him now that he is 58 years old he is decrepit. I wonder what did I do with my life how can I rescue what’s left. I feel like he is making me literally sick. Some days I cant breathe from anxiety, strain and stress. I left him twice through out our marriage. Each time I gained traction, health, peace of mind and strength. This time I just couldn’t bare to be without my children. But it’s taking a toll on me. I feel like I am in a state of this fog. 

Honestly courts don’t care it’s all about the money and a good lawyer. I was a house wife I couldn’t afford one. And he told the judge  I kidnapped my children when fled out of state. The state forced the children back to him. 
 He dragged me through the mud the narrative he played in court it was so despicable. 

I just wish I could find peace. Some real security. I wish I had an honest trusting individual in my life that genuinely cared. 
It would ease these days that paralyze me his insults, his sarcasm, passive aggression and his consistent plots and plans to just strip me of my basic rights and freedoms. 

It’s funny we take for granted that word freedom until we know what’s like to be without it. Freedom of not just coming and going though that to can be so important. How about freedom of thought, freedom of being yourself authenticity, freedom of knowing what you like and what you want. These are gifts. 
Freedom to financially support and secure yourself. 

I don’t know what other people maybe experiencing this to but I want you to know I know and I empathize because it takes a deep hard toll.

I left my abusive marriage and had my child 100% of the time.  When partial parental time was granted to my child’s father, I had a hard time with my “free time”. I signed up for a marathon. During training he lost his time with our child and while I was happy to be with my child 100% of the time again, I was unable to keep up with my training. I was undertrained for even the half but decided to drop down instead of out.  I secured a sitter but they had limited time and I needed to finish in 3.5 hours.

I now needed to finish in 3 hours… I contemplated just running back to my  car (10 miles away). I decided to believe in myself and I did it! 3 hours flat!

Currently all my belongings are back at the home that I left extremely abruplty. I have one bag of clothing to my name. 
Not able to return, for my safety. A none molestation is currently being set up. 

I have no job as was employed by his business, no savings due to financial abuse and codependency, applied for UC (starting mid march). God knows how I will pay for storage ‘once or if’ I get my things back. 

I’m having great difficulty getting my belongings. 
Through a friend I’ve learnt - he is getting his friends and family to rifle through my items and pack it all up and have them dumped at my elderly parents’ home (there’s no storage space there). 

This is not what I want. I need to sort my own items and pack away. Risk of damage and theft. I don’t trust him or his people/friends/family. 

My solicitor advised me to request the Police’s help. To chaperone me at the property. Today the Police advised me they actually don’t have the resources available to chaperone me to the property. 

My friend messaged him to ask if she can get my things. She’s been told no. This is all for him to try control it all, and mind games even after I have left.

4938,I need help understanding if this is abusive.,"I have been married to my husband for a little over 10 years. I truly believe he is a good soul, with good intentions. He and I both had some pretty shitty childhoods. He wants to be better. He truly tries. Marriage counseling, his own therapy, medication, etc. he tries. When he feels attacked, which can be anything, he lashes out and says things that hurt. I’m coming from my own background of trauma that leads me to believe that I don’t deserve to exist. I’ve masked this with a tough exterior. It’s  fake/short lived feelings of indignation where I stand up for myself and makes everyone think I’m strong followed by thinking I’m wrong and not just with him. I feel like I am surrounded by people that know how to hurt me so they can manipulate me but they don’t do it on purpose.

Is this abuse or just some other bs? And yes I am in therapy and have been for since I was 19.  I have a as in psychology (everyone please go ahead and roll your eyes at this. I do). 

How is it that a good person at their center can hurt someone they claim to love? The problem I have is I understand, at least partially in my own way, that they don’t mean to hurt and they want to be better. 

And as he points out, I do have my own issues. Who am I to judge? Obviously I am not perfect. I don’t claim to be perfect. I just wish that people would stop hurting one another. It fucking sucks to see what has been done to us, I want to lift you up. I don’t want to tear anyone down*

I’m not perfect. I try to reel myself back in when I feel like I’m RE acting in a way that is defensive. I have no problem saying, you’re right, I was wrong and I’m sorry can we talk it out. And hey I don’t will admit that rarely I can lash out in ways that are hurtful, but I feel like I have peeled back my defenses and have tried so hard to be vulnerable and real to be met with disrespect and shame.

4940,Why would he wait until 11 years into the relationship to show me who he really is?,"We have been together for 11 years, 1 child together . He has always been abusive to his parents but never to me. I guess that made me feel special. Suddenly In November of last year he decided to start being way more emotionally abusive. He was hospitalized in December and was the most amazing husband again. Like the man I believed I married. He's always been a bit emotionally and mentally abusive but I've been with him since I was 16 so I'm just used to feeling hurt or angry all the time. When it's good, it's GREAT.


A  week and a half ago he choked me. After that, he became increasingly angry, mentally and verbally abusive. He's mostly threatened his parents but was always argumentative any time I tried to talk or cuddle or get any kind of emotional support or intimacy. He would sit beside me in bed all day, stonewalling me  with an angry vibe radiating from him so I left him alone. But that made things worse because I wasn't comforting him the way he wanted. 

Would you be trying to cuddle and comfort someone when their whole demeanor and vibe is ""leave me alone or you'll regret it!!??"" I mean how am I supposed to know he wants comfort when he doesn't even look at me or talk to me? I was so in love but I'm feeling sad and angry and heartbroken and hopeless and lonely. I'm so overwhelmed mby all of these feelings.

Anyways, I don't understand why he's waited until 11 years in the relationship, plus marriage and a child before he started acting so hateful and abusive? Has this happened to anyone else? Does anyone know why someone would wait so long before showing their true colors? He knows exactly what to say to tear me down and make me feel even more worthless than I already do because of him. I've been so in love, especially during the periods where he's such an amazing husband and father. But he can change like flipping a switch 



TL;DR husband has always been emotionally abusive. Been with him since I was 16 so I thought it was normal until a friend told me.i put up with it because of how in love I am (was?)

I chose to believe him because it just seemed so out of character for him to do something like that. I told him that if I ever found out he was lying about this that we would be done.

My perspective on things has changed and after the things he has put me through over the last few years (abandoning me, the affair, emotional and verbal abuse, manipulation, etc), I now believe he is capable of what she said and of lying to me all these years. I know that I am justified in leaving now but I just haven’t been able to do it. Do you think anything good can come from me reaching back out to the woman who messaged me all these years ago?

4959,Mixed messages on treatment and DV hotline,"So I’m very confused right now. My husband has been very covertly abusive and controlling since his porn addiction was discovered back in April which led to an episode in November where after he had another relapse and was discovered he got very scary, blocked my exit when I tried to leave and verbally assaulted me telling me what a horrible wife I was. Later I fled the home and am separated and asked my husband to enroll in an abusive treatment program. Though there is porn addiction and alcohol abuse as well my DV therapist didn’t recommend 12 step programs because the treatment doesn’t address abuse and could actually cause the abuse to worsen. But when my husband called the DV hotline they told him he should enroll in an addiction program (not an abusive program) because that is the cause of the abuse. We’d been married for 10 years and though there was some blaming and manipulation the abuse wasn’t so obvious so they think (because I called the hotline to understand why they suggested that) that abuse isn’t at the core since it really wasn’t abusive until his addiction was discovered and the pattern of abuse isn’t there throughout the whole marriage but was just one major episode. So what do you all think? I wonder - if the PA and alcohol wasn’t there would he still be abusive? I think he would be. But the DV hotline doesn’t think so apparently.

4966,Abuse after 21 years together,"Hi all- I just joined this subreddit. My husband and I have been married for almost 22 years now. We had a great marriage until about a year ago. I know that’s hard to believe but it is true. We were best friends and companions, had physical/sexual attraction all of those years, shared similar beliefs, interests and hobbies. We raised a family together and were close and strong through all kinds of life’s hardships. Our marriage was just easy. This past year there have been all kinds of things happening that felt “off” or made me feel bad but I couldn’t put it together and since we have had a long history of happiness, I kept thinking it was me, or I was imagining things and excused stuff bc I couldn’t imagine he would hurt me. Several weeks ago I couldn’t ignore stuff any more after he blew up at me over something insignificant. After me walking on eggshells for a few days wondering what he would blow up over next, I asked him very specific questions about what was going on. He told me that he felt disgust and ontempt  for me for months and it was like a switch went off. He knew he was cruel to me the whole time but had dehumanized me so couldn’t and didn’t stop his horrible thoughts and behaviors. He was truly horrified by his behavior when we had our conversation and said it would stop immediately. We started MC a few weeks ago. Last week we had a couple of conversations where he became even more enraged towards me than before. I could feel his anger and he said overtly cruel things to me. I was afraid of him even though he never touched me. He said a couple of things that scared me and he later told me HE was scared when the words came out of his mouth bc he was so angry he knew it was possible he might hurt me. 

I was in a physically abusive relationship for a few months decades ago. My spouse’s behavior has been absolutely shocking because of our long history together. He is pursuing individual therapy right now and has a couple of appts with potential therapists and I do believe he 100% wants to do the work to change. Of course the actual change remains to be seen. 

I guess I am just wondering if anyone has experienced abusive behavior showing up years into a relationship. I also wonder if it is possible to save our relationship at this point because we have had more than two decades of a strong marriage and friendship but I know abusers often do not change .

Over half a year. I will go, but request an extension as it’s literally the day after tomorrow, he does have a lawyer. He made claims that I was abusive, hitting him and that he didn’t feel safe with me. No reports were ever filed. 
To give you context. I was pregnant with our second child when things digressed, and he detached himself from any spousal and parental duties for our first baby. He never had joint account with me, as I was stay at home home, he said that he will decide about the money, had to always ask him for money. He gave me silent treatment and stone walking for a solid five months, those leading up to birth. He never asked how I’m feeling, do I need anything, I begged him to come with me to marriage counseling, he came. He didn’t show up twice out of eight sessions. I drove myself to ER five days before my scheduled C-section as something felt off, he was home, saw me dressing up and leaving at 10 pm without asking me where to or anything. I was forceful about our relationship as it was alarming ng to me, his negligence, name calling, and kicking me out for months and two days before birth. Now I get this court order. Is he normal?!

4970,My story,"I grew up watching my parents fight and then live separately, but looking back I believe it is because they were both trying for separated life without a divorce, because divorce is a taboo in India. 

I didn't want to get married, obviously because I had two great role models! But I decided to obey parent's wish and because single women are frowned upon in India. They started searching for a husband for me and found Dave. 

Meeting Dave gave me a funny feeling. He always seemed to be on to something. I told my parents about my concerns but was ignored. There were many incidents involving Dave accusing me of not being good looking enough for him. The pinnacle came when he wanted me to undress for him on camera. I declined and informed parents. His mom didn't have a phone, the only number they gave was his sister's phone number, so when dad called and sister picked up, he had to tell the woman about Dave and requested her to speak with Dave about it. So my dad and I became the bad guys and his misbehaviour was swept under the carpet. Again my plea was ignored. That marriage was doomed because despite my pleading with my parents about the man's and his sister's behaviour towards me. 

The abuse only got worse after marriage. I decided enough was enough and did the unthinkable. Seperate from him and ask for divorce. But my parents were staunchly against it. Their advice was to suck it up for my kids.

After separation, I moved to bangalore where I met Gunda. Now Gunda was a single guy who according to him has recently broken up with his cheating girlfriend who was after him for his money apparently. And obviously I was his angel. But not for long though. 

After 6 long years of back and forth, I have finally come to my senses and left him. But my biggest regret and loss is my babies. 

Him and his parents kidnapped my babies and now I'm not allowed to see or talk to my babies. 

Gunda and his parents desperately want to get him married to a fair Naidu girl. But me and my babies are a huge block in their happiness. So they are trying to eliminate them. 

Currently he's kept them somewhere but soon he'll send them to orphanage or kill them. The only thing that stops them for temporary is because I've given complaint.

4971,Dealing with sexual coercion,"My ex husband repeatedly coerced me over our whole relationship. He would pressure, guilt trip and push alcohol to make me more agreeable. Over time I developed a pretty strong aversion. I tried so hard to force myself to want sex with him.. but my body just wouldn't. He ended up cheating on me because I wasn't sexual and ""kinky"" enough. He had developed a porn habit and liked watching women being degraded.

It's been 3 years and I can't move past it. I now have a very negative view on sex and my sexuality is mostly gone.  Every once in a while a small spark comes back....but that's maybe once every 3-6 months. I want it to come back to where it was before I met him. 

I feel like without being sexual I'm pretty much undatable to men and/or will only get cheated on again. I feel dysfunctional and I hate it.

He is still with his affair partner. He got 50/50 on everything in the divorce including child custody.

I haven't tried to press any charges. I know that even though sexual assault and rape in marriage might be technically illegal that he would never actually be persecuted unless it was extremely violent (with hospital reco). The court would say there's no proof and it's just ""he said, she said"". He got no consequences at all.... there's no justice.

4976,Give Me Your Thoughts,"My partner, well the father of some of my children, I have asked him to marry me, but he doesn’t want to do the paper work. He travels a lot for work. He is very good at it, top of his field. I couldn’t be more proud of him. Unfortunately he doesn’t make a lot of money. Compared to the amount of hours he is away from the family the finances don’t line up. But he gets money from his previous marriage so that helps. I try to work when I can, I was in an accident that resulted in me having a major mental crisis, that has brought a tremendous amount of strain into our relationship. I know he is already on the edge of being done with me, a lot of days I can’t get out of the basement.  

Sometime he will let me in on his projects to get my thoughts and opinions. I do my best, but my best holds him down. People have commented to him that my contributions, while free, and solicited by him, are not professional enough.

This evening he had another very important dinner event. We had made loose plans to go together, but since I worked during the day I thought maybe I could get the kids in bed and meet him later in the evening.  

We said that we would play it by ear. So when at 5:00 pm I got a text letting me know he would keep me updated I was excited to meet him out there. At 5:40 I asked “Hows it goin”

To which I got a 6:10 response saying that there were “not a ton of people”.

At 6:40 he told me his next big event in January was already sold out!

Over the next 4 hrs and 20 mins I sent 4 texts messages that were not responded to, the last one expressing my frustration with his lack of communication and that I was going to bed.

He came in at 11. He has given me the cold shoulder for the last few months, which is expect after my mental breakdown, but last night he actually got into bed and proceed to physically push up on me until I was literally forced out of the actual bed. To which he said nothing.  

I got up, turned out a light, put the cats away. He said nothing.

I left the room for an hour, he said nothing.  

When I returned he was either asleep or more likely passed out in the same spot where he pushed me out of bed.

This morning he said “sorry about that last night, I should have texted.”

He claimed that he put his phone down before 7 and did not look at it again, until… it is unclear when he did look at it.

4977,Does my marriage have any hope left?,"Quick overview to get to the point:
-I am 33F, he is 38M
-Been together half my life (17 years)
-2 kids, multiple businesses, beautiful home, money is good, family support, social life decent, overall wonderful life 
-lots of toxicity due to past mistrust & current alcohol-induced fights. We’ve agreed to stop drinking together
-both dealing with loss & grief of family and friends 
-both high stress level on regular basis due to work  

Here’s the problem:
- I love my family so much, they are my absolute WORLD, and I would absolutely never feel love like this for anyone or anything else- they are my reason for living, literally. I cannot lose them; we are all super close. 
- I battle depression, and the situation with my marriage has me in a crisis situation, spiraling my symptoms. Not medicated, but I do focus on routine & healthy habits to keep me going. 
- Our finances/businesses are intertwined & we run them together (I do half, he does half, and we couldn’t run either business without the other person)
- My husband has become violent on multiple occasions and is in complete denial about this very serious, very life-threatening problem. Two months ago makes twice, he’s used strangulation. Last night he punched a hole in our wall & my sister called the police. We lied when they got there bc I’m terrified his arrest will affect our business / it would throw us until financial ruin. He def should have/would have been arrested. 
-We are doing therapy session together this week, but I’m afraid he needs either inpatient to truly understand the abuse cycle , recognize his triggers, mental health help - or I’ll have no choice but to leave him. We don’t have health insurance(self payers). 
-he says my lack of affection & disregard to showing him love cause him anxiety & are the reason he is responding violently. I have been cold and distant due to control & violence, I think I’m living in a brain fog of denial and ptsd. I don’t show affection or attention bc I am resentful. I recognize the gaslighting. 

I am getting on anti-depressants again. I’m at my breaking point. I don’t want to leave my family or this life. I want to grow old with him. I want to enjoy grandchildren together. I want my kids to stay in their routines. I am desperately scrambling between wanting to run away from it all and hugging them all so tight, never giving up on us. I want to be married to HIM. 

I’ve done the research. I know the domestic violence statistics. I’ve been going to therapy. I’ve communicated this dire situation to my family. I don’t want to hear “run” “get out” “he is going to kill you” anymore. 

Is there hope for us? Can an abuser change if he works at it? Do I give him an ultimatum?",yes,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,yes,yes,plausibly,yes,yes,plausibly,plausibly,yes
4982,And now I have feelings for someone else…,"I posted here about a month ago. I’m contemplating leaving my husband. We have a little boy together. He’s been emotionally abusive and controlling and has threatened with violence a couple times. Since last month, when he realised I really want a divorce, he has owned up to all he has done. He will be getting help soon and we are starting couples counselling. I believe he doesn’t all do it out of cruelty but more so as a survival strategy (so I will take care of him). So I’m modestly hopeful things can improve at home though I’m very much struggling with feeling that I just don’t really love him anymore. And now i met someone. Who is everything my husband isn’t. Positive, caring, encouraging me to do things for ME again. I know that at least on a friendship level he feels the same connection as he has told me so (not sure romantically). Only thing is that he is married. We had the opportunity to both cheat but nothing happened, which only shows me he is the decent guy I assumed him to be. It just complicates things so much more. I now not only question my marriage because of the issues within it but also because I’m constantly thinking about someone else. How to find my way out of this… there’s no future with this other guy as I don’t want to wreck someone else’s marriage but I have absolutely no idea how to get my head and my life straight… it’s been so long since I’ve felt like this.

4996,I want to expose my narcissistic and abusive ex.,"I dated this guy for over 4 years, and found out that everything was a lie. He claimed to want a family and marriage and it turns out he got 3 women pregnant during our relationship. He has like 7 kids that I’ve found out about since the truth came out from another woman. He only pays child support for one child because all these girls are afraid of him or just want nothing to do with him and don’t take him to court. From talking to these women, he is dangerous when angry. And the instances I’ve heard about go unreported so none of it is on his record.

5004,"Divorce guilt, Emotional and Physical health is suffering","Been with my spouse for almost two decades. Verbal, emotional and psychological abuse. I’ve reached my threshold and I can’t seem to shake what logically I know to be true vs my brain always denying my reality and gaslighting my own experiences.

I flip flop from day to day, one day I am strong and so sure that this is done, it’s over and then the next day I’m second guessing myself. Then the guilt sets in because I’m the one who wants out and I will have to be the one to pull the trigger on divorce. This relationship and our marriage has damaged me mentally (I have been in therapy for years) and physically (I break out into hives all over my chest, face, neck whenever I’m talking … or sometimes just thinking … about my experiences). I have also had panic attacks in his presence and have developed chronic back pain (landed in emergency room twice from the extreme pain and fainting) and blood clots, to the point I almost died because my heart and lungs were full of clots (spent several days in the hospital) and a DVT in my leg. I chalked it up to hormonal birth control being the cause, that was almost ten years ago but then more clots were accidentally discovered in my lungs a couple years ago and I haven’t been on birth control since my first pulmonary embolism in 2014. Interestingly enough, I happened to stumble upon an article recently that linked chronic stress and being in fight or flight mode to your blood developing blood clots. This was extremely alarming to me and opened my eyes more than they already have been. Sure, these issues could be related to other health issues and not necessarily 100% caused by the extreme ups and downs of this relationship.

So, even after all of this, all that I read, listen to (podcasts) and watch — I’m still in denial that “it’s not that bad” and “marriage is hard so you just have to work harder.” I have tremendous guilt thinking that I want a divorce as I know it will change all of our lives forever. However, I know that staying will also do the same, perhaps in even more extreme ways thinking about my mental and physical health. We have a daughter and I just want what is best for her. I could write forever here and tell you all the ins and outs of our toxic relationship, but that would be too much to read.

5005,I want out of my marriage but I'm so scared. I feel like I can't breathe here.,"I (29F) have been with my husband (31M) for four years, married 1.5 years. I can't take it anymore. The first 2.5 years were a mess. There was emotional cheating on his part for the first nine months of our relationship. It was so horribly traumatizing for me; still, I forgave him because I loved him. We bought a condo together, and then the emotional and verbal abuse started. Three hour long fights on the regular where he would berate me for everything under the sun until I was sobbing on the floor, begging him to stop. He pressured me into sexual things I didn't want to do.

He went to therapy and got on a mood stabilizer which helped. I still married him, because I loved him still. He's less explosive now, but the damage is done. I don't feel safe with him, and I don't think I ever have, and I never will. We've been in couples counseling. Nothing helps. We don't have sex anymore, and I have to try not to physically recoil when he touches me in any way. He doesn't know how done I am. I can't let him know until I can stand on my own. I work very part time because of a disability and I have to find a job that works for me so I can support myself. I hate being here and pretending I'm fine. 

It's like the more I pull away, the harder he clings. Every time he tries to be affectionate, I try to give him a quick kiss and move, but he blocks my path and guilt trips me if I don't give him attention. I'm afraid of what he'd do if I breathe a word to him about not being happy. He drives me insane now and I don't want to be around him, but even me trying to hang out in the next room upsets him. I have to be around him all the time. I feel like I'm suffocating and I have no job prospects and I'm so depressed. I spend every day daydreaming about living on my own. I don't know what to do, and I can't tell any of my friends or my mother because they'll start trying to get involved if I don't leave him fast enough for their taste.

5007,Husband wants to abandon me and our kids…,"I’ve been married for 12 years and our relationship has been very tumultuous… I realized several years ago how abusive he was towards me (verbal and emotional mainly) and I’ve been trying my best to stand up to him, manage, and get on with life to take care of our kids as a stay at home mom. Within the last few days a huge secret came out and it shook me to my core and upset me a lot. We had several emotional talks to work through our feelings and argued a bit. 2 nights ago though I was just feeling so raw and let ALL my feelings out. I told him how I felt like he ruined my life and how messed up I must be to stay in an abusive relationship. I said so many things… we cried and it was so painful for us both. I felt like it was good to get it all out and he was really honest too and apologetic. 

The next day though (yesterday), he messaged me that he is going to file for divorce so he doesn’t ruin my life anymore. He also said he wanted to save the kids from the evil inside of him too… he has always been a bit dramatic but eventually calms down. I have no idea what to do or if he’s going to actually abandon us… I have no family or support in the city I live in and he knows that. He said me and the kids can move back to where I’m from and my parents can help me get back on my feet there. 

I feel so overwhelmed with heartbreak, fear, guilt… I don’t know how I’m going to manage suddenly being a single mom if he really does leave for good! I rely on him for a lot since we’re alone here… I know improbably should accept this and use it to finally “escape” my abusive marriage… but right now it hurts so bad and I need him to at least be here for the kids. I never thought he could abandon them and I still can’t believe it.. He is also saying he will at least send money for the kids “when he can” until he doesn’t anymore, then I’ll know he doesn’t “exist anymore” (meaning suicide..). ☹️ I don’t want my kids to loose their dad, he at least was a good father most of the time and they love him so much!

Before he met me, he slept with this girl (let us call her SUSAN), and she was the only one he had ever slept with. Susan disappeared from his life after we began dating. There was no contact, meet-up, or anything. 

Last December, he visited his village, where Susan stayed. She came to his room, made advances on him, and they kissed. He returned to town in January and left for the village again; this time, he brought a condom to sleep with Susan in case they became physical again.  And, yes, they do end up having sex, but he stops in the middle due to guilt. 

He kept it from me, but due to the guilt and shame he felt, he confessed to me on April 1st, apologizing profusely and promising never to do it again. I decided to give our relationship a chance, but after two weeks I could not take it anymore; the thought of him cheating on me was killing me. 

We have ended our relationship. 

I still love him, and while I do not want to be with him right now, deep down I hope to be with him again in the near future. But I am not sure that is a good thing to do. I can not decide whether I should move on or wait for him to grow up and fix his life.

5024,Husband (M29) drowned in his grief 2 years ago. Trying to rekindle our marriage but I (31F) don’t know how to not be a caretaker.,"My husband’s best friend since childhood died two years ago.

He was the person closest to my husband. My husband had never had anyone close to him die. All four of his grandparents are still alive.

The way his best friend died was traumatic as well.

My husband drowned in his grief. He would sob for hours a day and was numb for the rest of the day. He wouldn’t get out of bed. He lost his job. He wouldn’t eat or shower sometimes.

He was trying so hard but he was struggling.

I took care of him. Took him to a therapist, applied to jobs for him, set out clothes for him to wear to work, made snacks so he could eat something at least.

With a toddler and a grieving husband, I didn’t have time to think about myself.

Little by little, he got better. After the two year anniversary of his best friend’s death, he suddenly got so much better that I was worried there was something wrong. I was aware of warning signs.

But he has gotten so much better. He pulls more than his fair share as an unneeded apology for not being there and present.

We’re trying to rekindle our marriage but I’m struggling because I don’t know how not to be a caretaker.

When we went out for a dinner date, all I could do is check if my husband was picking at his plate, make sure he wasn’t cold or feverish, worry about his next appointment. I worried about our son too.

I used to be very concerned about a lot of things. I loved dressing up, doing skincare, working out, going out for new experiences. I loved looking good and feeling good.

I had a high maintenance routine and I loved romance more than anything. Now, I’m lucky if I do anything more than put on sunscreen. I don’t think about flowers or gifts I want. I don’t feel sexy or feminine. I don’t have passion for it.

How do we go about rekindling our romantic relationship when I don’t feel like a romance partner? I am struggling with it a lot.

5057,Narc served with divorce papers,"My Narc and I have been separated since April. Ever since then he has made it a point to make sure I know that he has a lawyer. He sends all of my email communication to his lawyer “to review before he responds”…. Even though he usually doesn’t respond at all… what his lawyer has to do with or why he would care if our 2 year old wears a pull up or underwear at night is beyond me. Anyway… since I found out about his affair he has completely erased me from his life and acts like our 11 year relationship and 4 year marriage never existed. He moved out, got his own apartment, own furniture, own stuff for the kids, changed his address with the post office, and hasn’t talked to me once since. Our only communication is through email about the kids and mutual bills and is completely robotic. He has never actually said that he wants a divorce- when I asked him directly after finding “the text” he only said “I do not want to be with you”. He has sent an email to someone else saying that we are “going through a separation”. I sent an email to him and asked if he could just tell me or email back that he wants a divorce. I just wanted to him to say that is or is not what he wants- no response. He has been trying to hurt me through restricting my access to our two very young children when they are with him, and suggesting that I will need to get a new job as he is “only temporarily arranging his parenting time to accommodate my night shift schedule”. All of this communication is “under the direction of his lawyer”. So I have been waiting to be served divorce papers for months…. And nothing… so I just went ahead and filed my own, since he obviously does not want to be married to me anymore. He was served yesterday. He sent me a text “I was served with papers after I got home with the boys”. I responded “Ok? Are you just notifying me as a courtesy or is there something you want to talk about?”. No response. This morning when we exchanged the baby in the parking lot he acted like I didn’t exist, as usual, but I also sensed some anger. I’m so confused by his behavior. He knew I had a lawyer, he has mentioned drafting paperwork several times, he is the one who doesn’t want to be married or have an intact family- I didn’t want any of this. Why did he make a point to tell me? I obviously know- I’m the one who filed…. Was he surprised? Did he think I was just going to sit around waiting while he threatens me with legal action?

My first was with a friend who kept asking me out for 3 years and once I committed, he slept with my best friend.

Got married to the second 1.5 years later only to realize he wanted to try it out with our 3 month old to see if she cli&$@(?!! Also found out that the marriage was actually “illegal” since he already has a wife elsewhere. Sorted out the legalities, got custody & left. Still numb, but safe for the next 4 years. Got married again.. the mom in law is an overt narc and her golden son is the covert..Spent 7 years trying to understand them but ultimately everything I do is wrong because I’m “not worthy” of her senior VP son. They kicked my parents out of the house when mine visited for a month…the same house my folks helped to buy.

5060,Watching the Cycle from the Outside,"It got slipped to me today that my nex referred to his new supply as his fiancée. I'm dealing with a lot of emotions about it ranging from anger about him moving on so fast to pity for the new girl he has wrapped up.

He had been getting supply from so many others during our relationship, he moved in with his new partner before we even divorced and used my savings to help her move. He has a long list of reoccurring APs and I feel stupid for being hurt even still by his ability to so casually move from one partner to the next without a care in the world for the attachments of those he hurts. On the other hand I feel like the biggest ""I told you so"" is coming after I tried to warn her about him. They own a business together and are  very public on social media, I just feel pity for her when he'll inevitably make her life miserable by wringing her dry. 

But maybe that won't happen. Maybe she'll have the happy life he always promised me during our good times. I was the second wife, however, and he did the same cycle with his first wife before me. He begged me for marriage at year 2 and then held it over my head for years before we actually tied the knot; When he was happy he constantly got caught up in the fantasy of how married life would be and how excited he was to be with me forever. When he was not happy he told me that marrying me would be his worst nightmare and to not hold my breath. After we got hitched the script didnt change; When he was happy he gushed about how blissful things were now we were married for life, when he was unhappy he screamed and cried about how being married to me was misery and he wanted to unalive himself. Theyre at the exact same timepoint in their relationship and I have watched it all start again.

Those years were the most unstable of my life so far, it cost me untold about of money, energy, and my whole 20s. I am so thankful to not be involved anymore. I am free and healing, I am starting to recognize myself again. We have to remember that there will be bumps in the road, healing is not linear.

Me I'm always outside of that somehow, I remember this to be the story of my life. I attract the weirdos and am attracted to them. I know this probably has to do with childhood trauma which I worked on and I've come a long way. I know a reward for all the hard work isn't around the corner like that, I'm doing it for myself and shouldn't expect anything 'in return' but damn it would be nice if things went well for a damn change.

I just long to fit in, have some normal caring loving arms around me and finally give my love to somebody who will give it back in a healthy way.

5080,I am broken.,"I (37F) was with my narc (35M) for 11 years.  We were married and had 2 children together.  I slowly came to the realization that there was something incredibly wrong with him, and my children and I went through physical, emotional, and financial abuse.  When he left he started seeing someone within a few months and within less than a month of meeting her he had her pregnant and moved in with her.  My kids were devastated.  I was devastated.  I had been holding out hope that he would get help, change, and come back and help me raise this family before I knew that narcs don’t change.  They have been together since.  We’ve been apart for 2 years now. Since the breakup, I have been alone with the kids.  He sees them supervised once a week.  I have been in therapy for 2 years.  I have C-PTSD. I am still so depressed.  Sometimes I don’t want to get out of bed, not because I miss him or wish it didn’t happen.  I feel like I am over him and see him for who he truly is, which is honestly pure evil.  He really has convinced himself and the people around him that he is a victim in all this.  It’s honestly disgusting. I just feel like my spirit is broken.  I am 2 years out and the thought of being in a relationship or dating still makes me physically sick.  I am so jaded I don’t let anyone close to me anymore except for my kids.  I trust nobody.  This makes me so sad.  I didn’t grow up in the greatest environment and my whole life I just wanted someone to love me as much as I loved them.  The thought of living the rest of my life alone is really upsetting me.

No support.,"So I married a narcissist and spent 13 years with him and had 4 children by him including one I already had when we met. I cut him off after he cheated on me on my birthday but said we was on a break for the night. (Lie number 100,000) I went no contact a full 14 days. Then we faced each other when he came and I ended up getting back with him. Then after 3 days realized it was a mistake because he told me he didn’t want to do this. So he continued to sleep on the couch for 2 nights until he didn’t come in the second night. I felt like I was smothering having him here. So I text him at 4am and told him to get his things and leave. It wasn’t a problem he already found a new supply and just used me to get a need met which was his car. But since all that I went no contact and today is my 5th day. I did my first bday party for our son alone. He hasn’t been getting them hardly just like the 14 days we didn’t talk. I work and take care of 5 kids, bills, and all of the above. This is the end of my marriage. There’s so much more than what I am posting but I am looking for support here.

5093,Narcs w/ No memory,"Questioning reality & Picking myself apart...

I could use some support.

My narc ex husband recently told me he doesn't remember anything about his history of abuse. He specifically asked me about the situation that led me to move out, where we had a disagreement & he tried to hit me. 

He physically intimidated me by raising his hand & lunging toward me. 

After I jumped backward to get away from him, I asked him if he was going to hit me & warned that he shouldn't because I'll have to call the police & I don't think he wants those problems. He backed down & left the house. Didn't return for over 5 hours.

He said he has no recollection of any of this.
He asked me to tell him the whole story & in my disbelief I tried. Then when I got upset, he said nevermind & he remembers everything & rushed off the phone.

I sat there stunned.

I feel like I'm in an alternate reality now. How could he not remember this? I've been picking myself apart ever since the conversation... 

*Questioning my own memory although I know for a fact that it happened. 

*Questioning what I could've done differently to make sure he knew this happened & was inexcusable. 

*Questioning my role in it, since he essentially had me rehash the whole thing & then asked me what I did to provoke him. 

*Questioning ""my interpretation"" of things vs. his reality... Just like throughout the marriage.

Idk how to get out of this spiral. It has stirred up lots of negative emotions for me.

5100,How do you learn to trust words again?,"I was raised by a covert narcissistic mother. I'm in therapy and have been for many years. I finally cut my mother off earlier this year.  

One of the biggest issues I continue to struggle with is how to trust someone's words. I grew up with everything having double meaning or being a route to guilt me later - ""o, you don't have to do anything special for me for mother's day! Treat it like a normal day"" ... ""Why didn't you celebrate me on mother's day?! Do you not love me?!"" O FFS.  

But I still really struggle in my marriage and with those closest to me when it comes to second guessing every word. I'm thinking about this specifically right now related to my husband. I'll ask for innocent cuddles (those not leading to *ahem* things). He'll agree. But I still don't believe it and therefore can't enjoy it. I'll be stiff the entire time, believing he's not going to respect my wishes and want to do Things. He's never been disrespectful or gone farther than I've been okay with. He'll be innocent. And my mind will rationalize that the guilt or trick is coming later. He can never win, and neither can I! I want to take him at his word!

5102,He moved on after 2 days,"My n-ex and I broke up on Saturday. He was full blown discarding me. I had caught him cheating with numerous women a month ago, and I stayed. But I couldn’t let it go, I tried to talk about it which was met with annoyance from him. He chose to spend all his free time with me. But he refused to talk about the cheating and hurt he put me through. He kept future faking and a day before we broke up he was talking about marriage and all this other BS. 

I had asked him to show me proof of where he was going on Saturday, he has made a crazy excuse of why he’d be late. He didn’t like that which led to an argument and him belittling myself and our relationship so I ended it. Two days later his brothers girlfriend thought I was the girl in his room, she texted me saying “please tell me you didn’t go back to him”. Well it wasn’t me, and that was information my heart could of done without. Realistically, he had obtained the new supply far before the discard. He was probably meeting up with her the night of the elaborate lie. 

He hasn’t come back. I haven’t reached out. This is for the best. I was feeling very much in my power and relived but I started to miss him terribly yesterday.

5103,A Huge Victory in Court,"I’ve lurked for a while here, but this is my first post. I had to share what happened yesterday with people who would understand. I separated from my Nhusband over 4 years ago (and got a protection order against him shortly after moving out). Our divorce was finalized 3.5 years ago. I do not engage him, however, because we have two kids together I can’t go full NC. I’ve had 3 PO’s against him and since the latest one he has turned to emailing my father calling me horrific names and making threats against me. My father doesn’t respond to them. The police won’t get involved. In these emails my ex repeatedly references his heavy drinking, acknowledges he has untreated mental health issues, and has even said he shouldn’t be around our children. He sees them sporadically at best and at one point didn’t see them for 2.5 months.  I finally had enough of the waiting around hoping he’d pull himself together for the sake of our children (which I know doesn’t happen when someone is a narcissist, but I tend to be an optimist anyway). Last month I filed to modify our parenting plan. Because he’s a narcissist he has been able to manipulate people through the court system in the past so I had very low expectations. But yesterday was the first time I ever felt acknowledged and understood by someone with the power to protect my kids and me. We had a telephonic hearing during which my ex was ordered to undergo a psych eval, substance abuse assessment, and a DV assessment. Plus he has to have supervised visits at least until all of his evaluations are completed and we go back to court to discuss those determinations. The commissioner said it was clear I tried to work with him to coparent, and that his drinking and “absolute hatred” of me was hindering his ability to parent. She ended the hearing by saying “I cannot get these emails out of my head.” (She also said the contents were too disgusting to read aloud in court.)
When we hung up from the hearing I cried and cried. I felt such relief and all my emotions just poured out. For years I wondered if taking the high road and not engaging would ever do anything. Sometimes I wondered why I left our marriage since I was still enduring his abuse. Yesterday made it all worth it.

5113,Ridiculous communication,"I was raised by narcs, and it has an impact on my marriage to this day. One of these problems is the after effects of being gaslighted so much; I doubt myself a lot and have trouble asserting myself when there's an issue in my relationship. One of our main issues is communication, but not (just) for the usual reasons. We're both autistic, which in our case means that:

* I have hyperfocus and usually have a pretty poor awareness of my surroundings;
* I have sensory issues which among other things means I have trouble understanding what I'm hearing (I tell people I'm ""a little deaf""; it's easier to understand and has a similar effect);
* my husband is terrible at explaining what he means (he can't visualise what other people don't understand);
* he doens't understand nonverbal signals very well;
* and not caused by autism but still annoying: he has a tendency to mumble the first half of his sentences.

This makes a lot of our communication a bit of a shitshow. I don't hear a lot of what he's saying, he doesn't understand what I didn't hear/don't understand, he can't deduct from my body language that I'm focused on something else, etc etc. I have to ask him to repeat himself a million times a day, and we get annoyed with each other *a lot* over this. 

It also makes me very insecure. Historically, any communication issue would be blamed on me. This makes it very hard for me to express myself on this issue. Today however, after 5 years, he did something so ridiculous I might actually start believing now that it isn't just me. 

Out of the blue he said to me: ""Quite interesting, trials where you're tempted with food."" and offered no other information. I was like ???? How am I supposed to respond to this??? What did I miss??? Out loud I said: ""What's the context?"". And then he gave me this whole story about a Star Trek thing he was watching about a Klingon bachelor party where the prospective partner had to go through these trials to see if he was worthy. Like.... How. TF. Was I supposed to get ""Klingong bachelor party"" from context clues???? The fact that it didn't even cross his mind that I might need an explanation beyond that first sentence...kinda blows my mind. 

So yeah. I got some definitive proof that it *REALLY* isn't just me lol. Can't gaslight this away (not that he does that, but you know what I mean). 

Now if only I can find a way to say: ""honey, just because I said something about onions being a staple of the commoners diet a few centuries ago doesn't mean I need a 15 minute lecture about the 80 Years War"" that'll be like 90% of our communication issues solved lol.",cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,no,no,,no,cannot be inferred,no,no,no,no,no,no
5130,It’s a rollercoaster... but I guess it’s mine now,"Hi, been a while since I posted. Left my husband about 5 months ago. I was in a pretty unhappy marriage - just felt like I was the neighbor who happened to live under the same roof. Wow, the whole last few months have been tough in some ways and slowly getting better in others. I will (edit) always regret not being able to stay in my original family unit, and having to live elsewhere in order to reclaim my life. But it’s really the only thing I could do to get happier. At least some days I remind myself that I have been through sooo much and I am still here and slowly my stress level has gone down and I am getting healthier mentally. I wish more than anything that I had married someone who could have been more honest, supportive, genuine, loving and able to be open to others, including me, my son and stepson. But I didn’t marry that person. I hit 50 and decided I could not live more of my life unhappy and lonely in a marriage. I see social media posts of families together and it rips me up. I remember when I posted about being 6 years cancer-free a while back (we were still married) and of the dozens of people who celebrated that with me with kind words, etc., he was not one. Nothing. No like, no mention to me that he was happy about it, and trust me, that’s the least of it. 

Don’t know what my point is, but the decision to leave was the right one, I just know that the very moment I want to feel sad and lonely is the moment I need to go out and do something positive.

5132,Really struggling - need advice,"So about 6 months ago I left my narc husband. We had been together for 15 years, have one child together.  I was SO sad and depressed in the marriage - moved from a big east coast city with friends and lots of opportunities, plenty going on, to a very small rural town about 2 hours away to live with him. He had a child from previous marriage.  Things are going ok- despite 'rona. I am starting to rebuild my life in a different town about 1/2 hour closer to big city, but it's been slow going. Some for obvious reasons.  I have a work space and mostly work by myself, doing some ""home schooling"" at the moment as well. I just feel like I've lost everything I was, and I don't really click with many people here. 

I am just having a hard time adjusting back into the mindset I had before -I knew how to make friends, I was much younger, the place I lived was full of like-minded people with dreams and lives.  Now I realize how much of my life I gave up, how sad the last years have been and how much I could have achieved. I've lost friends, some of whom I just lived too far away from to see regularly, I did most of the care taking for our child, and I just kind of shut down. I was sort of on top of whatever was going on in the world - and I see friends living ins exciting places who have families and extended families, friends they have made as a couple.  I really dont have any of that. The one couple we were friends with - well, turns out they weren't really friends. Long story.

I want to re-start my life, find new friends, etc. I am pretty active as a runner, but lately its hard to get out and socialize. I just have shut myself off. The people in the town I lived in with my ex- well I was NOTHING like the typical townie. I love living in big cities. Its just not in the cards at the moment. Feel my life is slipping away.

5143,What a surprise. He's angry 🙄... I could use some kind words of support from anyone out here...,"Made it pretty easy to say goodbye. I figured I had 1 of 2 choices. Try to reconcile the situation, like I've had to do a minimum of twice a week since the time we reached a mere 2 *months* of knowing one another... Or just call it off and relax. Either way, he's going to be angry. I went with the latter. My God. What an enlightening experience *he* was. 
 
I definitely knew better than to get involved with him, but I was in such a weakened state that I gave in. He is married, happily, and I let him in. I felt like it would be so nice to even be hurt by him. So nice to not be worrying about the real pain for awhile. In the meantime I got to feel exhilaration for even a short while. Forgot all about the real problems in my life for a time. 
 
Then the narcissist reared his ugly head. He threw more red flags than a communist parade. I made a decision to treat it like a case study. I wanted to quietly identify as many signs as possible.... Was this person a stark mad narcissist? Does narcissism even exist? Am I a narcissist? Are we *all* narcissists?  
 
I don't know the answer to those questions, but I do know one thing that was no surprise. The relationship was increasingly toxic, and became so at an alarming rate of speed. He *always* had a problem with me. And of course, when I asked, he *never* had these problems with his wife, lol. His marriage was great. But he was ""in love"" with me. He was so obviously full of contradiction it was plain laughable, and either he didn't see it, or he just was using these to confuse me. At any rate, whenever he had a problem with me, it would be days before it was solved. The conversation was always a dizzying rapid fire of id emotions, coming from him, that were near impossible to navigate every single time. 
 
Of course I feel the tug to make everything right. Of course I feel the need to sooth another person's unfavorable view of me. But *why?* and at what cost? How crazy it is that my people pleasing urge is so strong, that even when I can see a situation like this for what it is so easily, I still feel myself wanting to make someone happy who won't ever be happy with me.

5151,My whole childhood was a lie?,"I am a good daughter turned black sheep when I started FINALLY seeing nmom’s covert narcissism.  Was raised to believe my dad was abusing her throughout their 28 year marriage.  He was a bitter frustrated man sometimes, and other times kind, easy to talk to and fun.  During their divorce he and I had an argument over her and stopped talking and neither of us really tried to reconnect.  Me because I was still defending my mom’s honor and felt he should have tried and maybe explained himself.

The discovery of her narcissism was horrible- she tried to ruin my marriage and relationship with my kids.  We are all free from her now.  Now I am finding out that my dad was probably not abusive at all to her, just frustrated and fed up and afraid to loose us kids.  He still lost us for the last few years of his life, save a strained relationship with one of my brothers.  A recent survey- random as that sounds- with tons of questions about parents and upbringing just crushed me.  I had never put them side by side with an un-enmeshed brain.  He was so much better a parent than she by a landslide, but we were constantly fed odd weird comments about him and strange twists of Christianity to enforce her concepts.  

The more I saw she was capable of the more I questioned.  Talked to some relatives she tried to cut off and got some clarity.  Even after 28 years, I don’t remember bruises, supposed cracked ribs that she never suffered through, never hid in covering clothes like battered women do, nothing.  Having had my first husband be an abuser, I actually had bruises people saw, and it escalated over a couple years.  How could there be no witness, no evidence after 28 years.  

The last thing I’d ever want to do is not believe a woman who is being abused, but what when there’s no evidence of it and then you find out she’s a liar and manipulator who could care less if she rips your life away.

5152,Narc Women Can't Hold Onto Men,"I've noticed this, or maybe it's just me being observant, but the women in my family can't hang onto men. The men wise up and realize they are super control freaks. They bail on them, with numerous complaints of abusive behavior. The women deny it of course and try the victim route. They try their best to bad mouth the men first, or play victim with everyone they run into.

I'm the only successful woman in my family to hold onto a guy. Everyone has been divorced. Since I have no mental illnesses like NPD, or Bipolar, I'm wondering if this is why.

The odd thing is, my marriage was never treated serious (Married 12 years), until my husband confronted my NPD Mom about her behavior around me. She always acted like he wasn't really married to me and would often compare our anniversaries, as though it were a competition to see who was married the longest. I never got congratulations from her. I stopped announcing my successes along time ago though, because I know it will only make her compete, or say she was responsible.

She's married to a lesbian, but she thinks she was married ""longer than us,"" and I confronted her about needing to compete. I explained she wasn't married longer than us and what did that matter? She got furious. The rage and hatred in her eyes was surreal. I finally confronted the witch. Any happiness of mine was sucked dry and it was like being around an emotional vampire. I got tired of it and stood up to her in front of others. I didn't care if I ""made her look bad,"" anymore.

Also, she acts like her relationship is the only MOST SPECIAL ONE in the universe. They are lesbians, so we were constantly beat over the head with HOW SUPER GAY they were. NO disrespect to LGBT. I think it actually made it into a joke. It was as though she was trying to prove that they loved each other, way more than we could ever love each other, because of how gay they were.

I understand the need for power/control over you.

How can this be harder for me then being married for 20 years to a narc, who I have kids with. It seemed easier. Maybe I just replaced one narc with another. I know this guy is not good to me although I still want him to call me and think of me and he doesn’t care. I have an empty feeling and I cry constantly. I have a therapist, but I still feel like my heart is breaking worse with the second narc. I only was with him a year. I know this post is all over the place.

He is trying to create problems between my child and I.  He continues to lie in regards to everything he has done and makes its out to be where he is the victim and I'm the monster. My child has shared the awfulness of his narc father's behavior, words and treatment tours him. He is between 4-6 years old. 

He now has started to stage text messages to make me look like I'm the bad parent who is preventing him from seeing his child. He continues to lie and has been making up stories such as he is suffering from PTSD, failing test and much more. He is desperately trying to keep the attention and pity on him. 

When the mistress is around he becomes the father of the year but when left alone my poor child gets hurt. He moved rooms to be away from where he could be heard or my little one could be heard crying. 

He now continues to send text to make me feel threatened and scared. I'm finally working on taking the correct steps to help my little first and myself next. I continue to have nightmares and feel like I'm constantly looking around to make sure we are safe. The more I read about narcissist the more I realize how awful my marriage really was and how destructive this person has been and continues to try to be. 

Today he made the email sent look like once again I'm the parent who is being evil. I have reached a point where I no longer will entertain his sick ways and have chosen to not continue to engage in replying. I have come to see that only fuels his needs.

I noticed at the very beginning of the divorce process that he was not going to do anything that was in our divorce decree. See he made all the money and as a stay at home mom (we also have a child with a life threatening heart defect) I was nothing but that to him. He had so many secrets that I had no clue who he was anymore. He had an affair with my only sister, but since it wasn’t actual sex, my family kept it quite not wanting to hurt me until my narc sister got so mad at me she ended up telling me. Long story short he moved on to a whole new family. He controls my boys by buying them things every so often and just enough to fill there heads that it’s to the point my oldest son who I have always been close to started acting like my ex narc. He talks to me like I’m nothing and I worked my butt off getting us a nice apartment, while after 3 years they have yet to even stay a night with there dad.

5156,How did I not see that it was abuse?,"I spent 12 years married to my narcissist ex husband.   It got so bad at the end that he became physically abusive, but that still was not enough to make me want to leave.  He had such a grip on me mentally.  He decided that he was done with me and instead of just divorcing me he manipulated me into a suicide attempt.  Even THAT was not enough for me to wake up, and none of the professionals I saw after noticed any of the classic signs of abuse.  

I have been free for 4 years.  

Doing some spring cleaning this weekend I found one of my old journals covering a period of 2 years, the last of my marriage and the first of my freedom and recovery. 

When I first suspected he was cheating on me he convinced me that I was just stressed and had anxiety, and convinced me to go to a doctor for medication.

5157,Symptoms after years of emotional abuse,"Hi-

I have been in a 12 year marriage where emotional abuse has been a occurring since we before we got married. The last two years have been the worst. I started planning to leave. I got a job, hired an attorney and started lying the ground work. I am emotionally checked out from my marriage. However, his loss of control over me has made him more mean than ever before. 80% of our interactions are toxic. I remain calm and can bottle things up like I have been doing for a very very long time. My issue is that now things are happening to my body. For instance when I hear yelling, I get triggered and have heart palpitations or eye twitches. I am physically exhausted. Most people think it’s bc I am working now, so it’s easy to say that’s the reason. Over the weekend I was driving and blacked out for 30 seconds. I was not in a stressful situation during the time but went to the hospital and had high blood pressure and an elevated heart rate. I am terrified that I am going to have a stroke or heart attack.

5158,"Feeling stuck in marriage, is their hope?","My husband(26 M) and I(26 F) have been married for 2 1/2 years now, been together since 2017. We have been going through a “in house” separation for the last six months. Over the last 3 years I have felt extremely neglected, begging for dates, quality time etc. but he always seemed to choose his friends. He told me that he didn’t want to be “romantic” because he felt like we weren’t having enough sex. So, over these last three years I’ve made it a priority to meet his needs that way, because he kept promising that if I did that, he would be more inclined to meet my needs. 

Well one day about 6 months ago I hit a wall. I couldn’t do it anymore, he wasn’t meeting me in the middle and my cup was empty. So I told him that I needed a separation, and that if things didn’t change I couldn’t stay in this marriage. 
He started slowly taking steps on meeting my needs. It’s been a lot of highs and lows and very slow progress. During this time, he admitted to me that he had an emotional affair shortly before our wedding. So that was a huge blow to me. I felt so betrayed that during the time I was trying to meet him in the middle and better our relationship, he was giving that effort to someone else. 

I’ve been doing my best to try to learn to trust him again, and try to gain that emotional& physical connection. We went on a vacation, been going on dates, reading self help books etc. It still didn’t seem to work so I started talking to a therapist, and journaling, working out, trying to see if that would help, but I feel like I’m not making any progress. I feel so horribly guilty. He has really been working hard to be better for me and made progress, but nothing seems to help.

I know the results are the same, I feel like I'm barely alive. But what if there was genuinely no intent?

I (46F) have been with my husband (49M) for 27 years. The entire time, I've pointed out actions that have hurt me (intentionally skipping my birthday, or Mother's day never defending me when his mom made fun of my weight, my parenting, even my dead parents, etc. There's also a sexual aspect to his actions.) 

About 3 years ago, I started to fall apart. It took until this March for me to scream at him for hours on multiple occasions for him to hear me, start to realize the damage he has caused. 

The thing is, I genuinely think he didn't know he was hurting me? (Except the birthday thing. It's obviously intentional, but he says he doesn't know why he did it... Fine line.) He repeated the way he saw marriage modeled by his parents. Ignorant, absolutely, but he's been so shocked to finally see the consequences. I'm broken, empty, I've never felt this horrible and, thanks to near constant nightmares and flashbacks, I'm keep getting worse. I'm broken.

Regardless long story short, I know I need to leave but right now I’m just not ready. This reality and awareness is so stressful for me. I decided to go to a counselor just to clear my head and give me some emotional support and guidance. I told him everything my husband says and does. The counselor said that my husband is emotionally abusive and engages in gaslighting. But then his only suggestion for me is to start couples counseling.  He says he supports keeping marriages together. I was a little at a loss because I told him directly I was there because I’d made the decision to leave.

I got us into therapy, confronted everything, and the therapist confirmed it all and made sure he didn’t squirm out of it, or manipulate it…and him being the bad good guy, seems to have confronted it and is listening and apologizing and seeing some of the damage he’s caused our family…
He’s had a few backslides, more painful words and non physical attacks. Again the therapist pointedly told him he’s a taker and not letting him weasel out of it…
I had a bit of one on one time with the therapist and she said she sees a lot of hope in him because he’s not fighting it or blowing it off,  but listening instead and making small but steady improvements (despite those painful bumps which I guess I keep having to deal with as he goes to a lot of therapy and continue to heal…
So that’s the best case scenario, right?
Except my body is TELLING ME. Ooh, I am in burnout (again) BAD. See, I was already in a corner before I faced this all head on. My best friend was murdered, my mom died suddenly, my family turned on me (the original abusers, which I thought my husband kind of saved my frame of mind from, made me feel like I wasn’t alone and had real love…but I guess this was a really co-dependent way of seeing this, knowing what I know now).

And now I see that this person chose himself over me, held my head underwater so he could breathe all these years…he chose himself while I did EVERYTHING emotional (and we have had a turbulent life outside of our marriage, facing a lot of big life stuff “together”)…I was already so burnt out, so in pain…then I peeled this scab off with confronting him with the therapist and was right, I was right about it all…I’m just so sad. I really have no support and I’ve got to face that this relationship has been supported on my emotions for so long. I’m numb and sad. And I guess I’ve got to just deal with it, because we all know what’ll happen if I pour my heart out to him- it would be me just convincing myself I had what I needed…and I don’t yet. I don’t know if he has the capacity to love me like I need. He says he wants to try and is so sorry and doesn’t ever want to be that person again.

5170,I broke up with my abuser and I feel horrible,"TLDR: I feel like trash for breaking up with my abuser because they seemed to believe everything was amazing in our relationship and seem genuinely sad. Any advice?  

I feel like such garbage. I’ve been in a 3.5 year on and off relationship that has been very emotionally abusive and I still feel horrible for breaking up with them. They seem so hurt. Genuinely hurt. And I feel at fault because I only just said that it is hurtful when they yell at me. I didn’t even say that I’m terrified of them when they throw and break things. But also I feel like I can’t say those things without worrying about how they’ll respond. And I feel conflicted because they don’t seem to see that as an issue or want to get therapy or help. They’ve been throwing things for 3 years. I guess I made the mistake of comforting them afterwards, which I guess makes it seem like everything’s okay. That’s one me I guess. 
 
They also have serious mental health issues but they don’t want to get help. And I feel like I can’t say things like I want a partner who is willing to get help and not just rely on me. But I’ve been caretaking for 3 years. I’ve lost all sense of self. 

They asked yesterday what my thoughts on marriage were and I (24f) said that I’m not in a place that I want to be in to be married. This was a very big deal. Basically they gave me an ultimatum. But it was so confusing because I would say things like yes I can see myself marrying you in the future I just don’t know when I’ll be ready, but at times they would tell me that all I’ve done is reject them and told them they’re ugly and worthless and horrible, but I never said those things. We broke up last night at about 4:30 it was horrible. 

But today we made the mistake of talking to their parents, who as far as I can tell are very happy that I’m taking care of their child for them. They wanted us to go to couples therapy and I said sure I’ll try. Which I realized after was a big mistake and I feel bad because that was confusing to be like sure I’ll give it a try to no I can’t. Because I realized I can’t marry them. I have wasted away these last 3.5 years and I’m not myself anymore. I can’t do it anymore. 

So I broke up with them and they are seemingly genuinely hurt. I feel horrible for not telling them things and trying to change things, but I didn’t feel like I can tell them without causing an episode.

5171,Prolonged Grief Syndrome,"I am so aware and awake about everything my husband (of 25 years) has done and continues to do. If he was honest in therapy, he'd get a covert narc diagnosis. That sums it up pretty much. I've been pretty much tortured by behaviour I never saw until six years ago. Something in his brain broke. And it made a horrible mess when it did.

I cannot leave - I am not too emotionally attached to leave, but there are ZERO feasible supports for me to do so. I tried two years ago and it was a glorious five months before finances forced me to come back. I've recently gone through another round of seeking help, and it's not happening this year either. I've been sleeping in my own room for five years now and I'm more than sick of it.

So, why am I still crying (more like uncontrollable sobbing) more than once a day? And it's grief, absolutely no doubt, all my thoughts are about how my life just kind of died six years ago. And I sob wanting my life back. There were no cycles of love bombing and devaluation then. Everything was so stable it looked boring (neither of us were bored). Where did it go? What happened to him? Where did he go? And I grieve for that boring stable kind man, but even more I grieve our marriage. My whole adult life was with him, how did we get here?

And that goes around and around and it gets worse, not better, the longer I have to live with the newborn monster. You'd think the grief part should have been rather lessened by now. I'm bawling over people holding hands for crying out loud.

I'm bipolar, already had PTSD going into this, and I am medicated to the point I'd be a zombie (well, more of a zombie) if I added more. The medication kept me stable before this happened. I had a bazillion hours of therapy. I wasn't normal per se but I could live my life normally most of the time.

Please tell me this is a thing and there is some sort of education I can read/listen to that might help. Therapy isn't an option but knowledge has been my power thus far. Why am I still crying, and if I'm honest, considering ending it all every day? I need to know how to move on from this before it eats me alive.

5174,Should I care when he doesn't?,"I think my husband is emotionally abusive. 
Him and I have been married almost 7 years and we have 2 children together. I have another child I had in a previous relationship. 

I could write a long story explaining why i think he's abusive..I almost did, but it would sound almost the same as everyone else's story, and I don't need validation for my experience. 

I'm tipping on the divorce side of our marriage. I gave him 5 years in a previous conversation to work on himself, while I work on myself and go back to school, and start working. 

We both have unhealed trauma so I'm allowing him grace. But, his inability to budge in the emotional availability part has got me ready to call it all off. He agreed to get help 7 months ago. Little to no progress has been made. 
One point that I brought to him is how he treats my children. Specifically the teenager that's trying to figure out how to be human. My husband reacts in anger. That's a no go for me. No matter how many times I try to communicate it. How it hurts me, my kids. No matter how many times my kids tell him...the AHA moment where he just gets it, unfortunately, hasn't happened for my husband. 
I can't continue to care for his emotional needs over myself and my children. My husband has already said he doesn't want to be around the oldest child, he actively ignores the child, only communication is criticism. So, am I justified to just not give my husband my emotional energy when it comes to defending my parenting choices?

Long story short, whenever I do something he doesn't like, or want him to compromise on something in our marriage, he starts to threaten me, not physically but I'd say with things he knows will really get to me? Today, he started with the threats which were along the lines of 'if you don't stop, things are going to get worse and you will be the one crying'  and 'if you carry on, I'm going to start going on x, y, z websites' and 'if you carry on, I will start hiding things from you and then you'll really know what it feels like for me to keep things from you'. He knows I have anxiety and mentally I can't cope with the thought of a dishonest marriage, as honesty and trust are so important to me, but I don't really know where to go from here. And by ""carry on"" he means continue with the argument, or keep going on at him about something I feel strongly about. 

I don't know the point of this post. I guess it's just to rant and to share this as noone knows this side of him but me and when he's finished with his narcissistic side for the week/month, I even feel like I imagined it.

5188,Losing hope for a better way.,"Sharing thoughts as I navigate leaving a DV relationship.  Some background: We have been married for 8 years, together for 10.  Three kids, then 9 now 19.  Looking back I clearly see verbal and emotional abuse mostly toward my kids. I'm really not clear if spouse's behavior can be considered DV against me. 

The past couple months have been super calm. I've also pulled way, way away. I've joined a trauma support group just to get some insight. The organization is helping me get out. But now I have doubts.

My brain is filled with thoughts of things spouse does for me/family. Notably they make food, damn good food, and always considering dietary needs. Spouse works hard on the vehicles when they need repair. Spouse never ever calls me names, challenges what I do or don't do with house chores, and mostly doesn't criticize my actions. I can't say I give the same back to spouse.

When did things start to break apart? The first episode was about a year into our marriage. Spouse had been verbally abusing kids for really stupid stuff.  IMHO, it's always stupid stuff. Kids started to pull away and isolate in their rooms. I talked with them, independently, them spoke to spouse. Explained how they were feeling, why they felt that way, and asked spouse to apologize. Spouse immediately denied any harm doing and challenged my knowledge of how the kids were feeling. No apology, no behavior change, no family conversation. And it grew from there.

Over the years spouse kicked one kid out twice (only verbally no action but still), another kid and myself out once (still only verbally no action). Threatened to kill kids' father, physically fought kids' father, mocked and made light of the fight. Spouse, I believe, is a hoarder, and never taken care of the house as promised when we moved in but did give the kids each their own room. Spouse has been very verbally aggressive. And such...

5190,What does this mean?,"I'm (35F) in an emotionally and psychologically abusive marriage with my husband (31M). We have an 8 month old baby girl. I'm currently trying to figure out my next move. 

We got in a fight the other day and I'm a little confused on what to think. Tension is already high because we haven't been speaking to each other. I'm tired of the abuse and he acts like it's no big deal or that it's my fault, so I kind of shut down. 

Anytime I try to stand up for myself and say, ""Don't speak to me like that"" it only escalates the situation. He gets super mad when I ask for respect or tell him not to speak to me disrespectfully. 

During our fight he told me to shut up, so I responded, ""Don't speak to me that way."" He has the baby in his arms and he quickly gets off the couch and gets in my face and says, ""Do something about it! Do it! Do it!"" He then hands me the baby and I'm speechless. What did he mean by this? 

Today he did something similar. A fight started and he was holding the baby and getting frustrated. He got so mad and he got in my face and yelled, ""Get out! Leave! Get out of my face right now! You're a waste of my space.""

I don't yell, scream, or get in his face, or call him names. I'm a pretty calm person and I know how to communicate respectfully.

5194,How do you know you're not the abuser?,"This has been messing with me for a while and I can't seem to get past it. I have a really deep history of childhood emotional abuse. He knows this. I am also waging an ongoing war with treatment resistant depression (over 20 years). I've had LOTS of therapy, some good, some ok, one maybe(?) terrible (that was a marriage counselor, it's a messy story).

Anyways, we were in the middle of a fight and he shot out, ""You're abusing me!"" (I wish I could remember exactly what I said, I think it's because I disputed his recollection of events...  I wish it were not the case, but we frequently have arguments about what did or did not happen, or what was or was not said). That statement stopped me cold. Suddenly it felt like someone had stuck my soul into a freezer.

I very carefully removed all emotion from my voice and said, ""Do you really feel that way?"" He said (still angry, still fighting) ""Yes! You abuse me but it's ok! I can deal with it, some level of abuse is normal in relationships!"" (He'd just slammed his fist against a wall in anger earlier. Sidenote: I am definitely not innocent of anger issues of my own, but I generally do not let them out in a fight. They come out more strangely and randomly, like when the dog stole my last kitchen glove and I ""punched"" an oven mitt hanging on a hanging rack kinda like a punching bag. He's slammed some things around in anger recently, but I can't really blame him when I do things like that, I think.)
More color: I've had dark, dark times. Sometimes I honestly don't know if I'll make it to the other side of whatever the depression has in store this time. He knows that I have a history of suicidal ideation and have been hospitalized. He knows I'm on meds and probably will be forever.

Continuing the story: I was so horrified that I told him that even if HE'S ok with it, I am MOST CERTAINLY NOT. If he really feels that way, we need to have a conversation about what he thinks I'm doing that's abusive. But I couldn't get answers. 

So here's my question: how do you know if you're the abuser? I'm so terrified that I will become my mother, it makes me sick. I literally start to feel my skin crawl if I think about it. Then I start to tear up. How do you know you're in the right? For that matter, how do you know you're in the wrong?",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes
5195,Coming to terms,"I guess I just don’t know how I didn’t see it as emotional abuse until now.

How I shouldered all of the blame for every problem in our relationship. 

How I thought something was inherently wrong with me, that I’m just a bad person, the less deserving one who is lucky to be in this relationship, that my flaws are the root cause of everything that goes wrong.

How I thought I was just too sensitive or hormonal and overreacted to the small things.

How my perfectionistic and forgiving nature was used against me. 

I never thought for one second that any of those thought patterns were something I was manipulated into. I’ve always had my insecurities and I opened up about those. I never thought it would be used against me. Im not even sure if he’s conscious he’s doing it.

I’m allowing myself time to process.

I’m going on five days of silent treatment for I’m not even sure what. It’s been waves of this for the last six months. My mental, emotional and even physical health are something I battle to take care of every single day. I haven’t felt happiness in almost a year. All 3 trips we’ve been on this past year have resulted in me crying on the bathroom floor alone at some point for being a bad person, inconsiderate and irresponsible. Never comforted, just back to normal when he decides he’s forgiven me. 

Let alone the fact I would never, ever put my partner through that. I’ve never spoken a hateful word to or about him, his character, who he is. I would never see my partner sobbing and leave them in comforted, without compassion.

I don’t feel loved or held or cherished. I cry alone every single night when he’s still at work, so he can’t see that he’s affecting me. Because that’s the only thing that’s worked, is pretending I’m okay. 

I miss feeling loved. Feeling seen. Feeling cared for. We had that once, or so I thought. And I love him. I knew marriage would be work. But I can’t go on like this much longer. I don’t know what to do and I feel so alone.

5198,Why am I losing strength?,"In the beginning I wouldn’t defend myself, just be silently sad. Then I started to fight back and even get down on my knees begging him to change. And as usual, the love and good times (although much less than the bad times), finances too, make it SO hard to leave. 

I went back to my family temporarily (at his suggestion) despite trying to get him to ‘see the light’ before leaving. Saw it didn’t work, had to try something different even if it’s a 1% chance but honestly I just needed to leave at that point too. 

When he could tell I wasn’t happy about coming back (this wasn’t supposed to be a legit separation, I gave in when he called me after leaving and said he’ll drive back up with me, I couldn’t say no, just couldn’t), he told me I’m on a effing vacation and all this other mean stuff, even told me to stop spending his money. Had one fight since I’ve come back, all because I kept trying to ask him how his anger management therapy is going, he didn’t wanna talk about it got mad (even though he had joined it partly for me he said…he tried to get me out of our apartment before that then broke down later that night all sorry, kept telling me “when are you gonna be done packing”, “I wanna see you pack” if I sat down for a break etc).  Even accused me of some mean things financially. My therapist whose also a marriage counselor suggested I ask him to come to marriage counseling (although in my last meeting he told me this guy is unlikely to change) and I want to try that last straw for my peace of mind (although he’ll say no). Then I will TRY to push myself for a divorce. 

But this time I feel so down and scared. like I can’t stand another fight, like my spirit is broken. My heart starts beating even imagining asking him. I should’ve ended things when I left, it was the perfect opportunity because he was being a jerk and had zero remorse for the way he is but too late. Now I’m so mentally broken I can’t fight, stand up for my rights, anything. If you’re interested in the issues here’s a post from another subreddit:

I'm not allowed to have a job and stay home all day(I do surveys to make some money he then asks me every time to use my money) If I disagree with him he gets angry and saying anything he can just to hurt me.

He threatens to pawn the laptop, our tv, or anything else that we have.) He has pawned other things already so I know he will. He also threatens to break these things.

I noticed not long after we started dating that he had some addiction issues. He of course lied and denied it for almost a year and a half. Always hiding things from me and lying. He finally got sober and I am so proud of him, and he hasn't looked back. But the constant lies definitely put a toll on me. 

He drives very dangerously, and when I say something he gets so angry. I have literally told him to let me out of the car and he wouldn't. 

He has called me names that I won't type here, but he will buy me things as a way of making up for it. 

He would get angry if I went out with friends and would be very suspicious of any male friends. Of course he was sweet as pie to their faces. 

One year on my birthday, he got so angry that I went out to eat with a friend and not him (he was napping) that he refused to come to my party. 

He has said F you to me while we were in an argument in a public place. 

He got so drunk one night he fell asleep in his car outside of my work and my manager had to come out and take his keys from him. After getting him home he stole my keys and dropped my car off at my work and brought his truck back home. He has no recollection of this. 

He asked me to order him a pizza one night and I completely forgot. He proceeds to yell about how I cant make it without him. Something in me snapped and I just sat there in silence ignoring him. This makes him even more angry and he starts yelling about divorce. This was the last incident that has me looking at all of these incidences and questioning things. 

Of course I have to say that things are not always bad. We have great times. He can be kind and generous and funny. But after the last incident I became deeply depressed. It took me a while to realize why but then I realized it was because of the things he said to me.

He never once physically hit me but the emotional abuse and mental manipulation is still something I'm dealing with. Possibly because I'm really good at avoiding hard things and I'm still legally married to him.

We live in the same small town. Thankfully he isn't social and I don't see him out and about, but he has followed me around a Walmart. Somehow found my throw away accounts on here and left comments that were not very nice.

I wasn't perfect. I made poor choices as a result of his actions, but I have seen what I did was wrong and apologized to him. He is still in denial that he did anything wrong.

My biggest fear is that when I do get the divorce done, will he ever really leave me alone? He was single for a long time, and he has a lot of mental issues that made it seem like maybe I was the only one dumb enough to try to help him and fix him. 

I've been gone for almost 4 years and he still tries to message me. Finds me on every social media outlet. I've been with someone else for 4 years now.

I'm struggling with finally standing up for myself and kids and find myself doubting whether or not I'm being too harsh with wanting to leave and not wait for him to change and rebuild trust after decades together. 
Things have been falling apart for 5 years - trust was broken and he swore he changed 2 yrs ago and stopped drinking.  Recently he decided that he needs to manage his anger better, got self help books (hard pass at therapy, he quit marriage therapy years ago), and seems to be trying to be better - expressing appreciation, trying to be patient, no snarky comments or criticisms, kind of helps around the house, etc.  
My friends and family are all like, ""oh great, he's making changes, you must be so happy!  You should give him things around the house to help you with to teach him!""  And he seems to be love bombing me a bit - flowers, using his nicer car, etc all while puppy dog eyes across the room.  But I'm walking on eggshells wondering if it will last...and then second guessing myself.
Am I hurting him by being distant, not being physically affectionate, being vulnerable?  He's trying - should I be too?
I worry that I focus lately only on the bad times, perhaps was too sensitive, was too submissive to stand up for myself, overgeneralizing, etc.  There was no clear namecalling or threats - just a long history of somewhat controlling, critical, unsupportive, disrespectful, etc. behavior. 
My very patient therapist says that it is emotional abuse in their opinion.  But then I read posts about ""emotional abuse"", ""narcissism"", and ""gaslighting"" being popular buzzwords and just excuses to leave a relationship and I doubt myself again.

Afterwards, we took an Uber back to our venue where we had a room for the night. Since we were both a bit drunk, we had a hard time remembering how to get to the room and such so we were bickering. At some point I grew frustrated of walking around what seemed in circles and said I’ll just be calling someone for help since he was useless. I admit that I shouldn’t have said that, and it was just growing frustration from just wanting to reach our room and call it a night. After I said this, he grabbed me by the shoulders, shoved me backwards against a brick wall and put his  hands around my neck. I hardly remember what he was saying to me. I was just in shock. He let go after what felt like a while but probably was 3-5 seconds and walked away. I don’t know how I did it but I ran in the opposite direction, crying and just hysterical until I found our room. I locked my self in the bathroom and just bawled. He found his way into the room as well but wasn’t being aggressive, just walked in and sat by the door until I came out. I cried the entire night, on what was supposed to be an amazing first night as husband and wife. The next morning I asked him if he remembered anything from last night and he said he did. When I asked if there was anything he wanted to say to me- he said he didn’t. I couldn’t bare the thought of going to breakfast with our families but I did, we put on a united front.

5220,Abuse & Money,"I've been with my husband for 15 years (married for 8 years, although I am moving out ,as we are separating).  The entire time we've been together he's been hyper focused on saving/investing money.  He has quite lofty financial goals - I've never been a saver like him and it has caused numerous issues in our marriage.  

Examples: 

* When we talked about divorce, he said that if I went after his money that he would ""f\*\*\*ing kill me"" and then kill himself. 
* He wanted me to save/invest half of each paycheck, and for a while did not have me pay ""rent"" on our fully paid off home, this was his way of claiming that it was him putting the money into the investment accounts.  (The compound interest on this amount was over $20,000; totaling $35,000).  When I said I wanted to leave the relationship, he claimed he wanted this money and wouldn't stop harassing me about it....I caved and gave him the money. He would make comments any time I purchased something, saying I shouldn't be spending money when I owe him so much. 
* He gave me $6,000 to put into a brokerage account, but wanted to be paid back-which was not a problem.  However, he wanted me to pay him interest! And once he realized I was serious about moving out, he said that I was leaving him high and dry because now he has to pay all of the bills by himself.  
* His brother has been convicted of a crime and found guilty - my husband is pouring tens of thousands of dollars into attorney fees, jury investigators, etc.  He told me that if I loved him I would have helped pay for the jury investigator....so guess what I did? Gave him another $7,000! 

I know it is insane, and I can't believe I've done this financially. And now, I'm moving into my own apartment and am responsible for all utilities and I'm starting over with household items.  But honestly, the way he reacts about money (and most things) is terrifying, I've tried explaining this to my sister (very supportive, but she couldn't believe I'd given him the money).  It's just easier....and I feel stupid saying that, but it's easier to give him the money so he'll stop, and then there's **nothing** tying me to him anymore.  

I'm not really sure what anyone can say in response to this - but god, it feels good to just get it out there.  I really do feel so stupid for letting him talk me out of all of this money, but sometimes it didn't feel like I had a choice.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred
5221,My husband really pulled the wool over my eyes,"First meeting him was fateful. Dating him was smooth. Getting engaged was dreamy. Getting married was exciting. 

And at some point in our first year of marriage, some of his facade started to crumble. I got glimpses of his desire for control. 

Some of the things he now tells me are not the same as what he used to tell me. Prime example: why he wanted to get married. When we were getting engaged, it was because he loved me and my family and he wanted to be with me and create a family together. Now his reasoning is ""because we were living in sin by having premarital sex and I wanted to do things right."" He brought up the premarital sex making him guilty a MONTH before our wedding and when I told him we can abstain until we're married he assured me that' wasn't what he wanted to do. 

He seems to have gotten more conservative (or delusional) since we've been married: now having a Christmas tree is ""evil"" when before it was too much work, he's the head of the household when before we were a team, and my hormonal birth control is unnatural and poses a risk to my future fertility when before it was the proper decision for me and my health. (Don't worry, I'm not stopping my bc.)

He thinks when I can't do something physically it's because I'm just not listening to him - like the fact I couldn't paddle in an ocean kayak was because I didn't want to listen to him, not because I was getting pummeled with waves and physically could not.

And he has yet to apologize for the major emotional mindfucks he's bestowed upon me over the past week, let alone the major ones over the past few months.

5222,Only now realizing how much stress he causes me! Emotional abuse?,"I'm on a 2 week-long work trip. This is the first time my husband and I have been apart in our 3 year marriage. I thought I would find these two weeks difficult, but it turns out I'm more relaxed than I have been in YEARS. Since I've been away I realized that everyday I spent with him I was anxious. At the time I attributed it to being away from home (we live in his home state), but I now realize it's because he had so many expectations of me and I was always worried I would get ""in trouble"". He is a clean-freak, always feels his best when the house is spotless. I'm a more casual cleaner. I keep things tidy, but occasionally I'll leave some clothes on my closet floor or take a couple hours to do my dishes. When we moved in together (into his house) he would get very annoyed when I did the aforementioned and ask that I stop. I complied and keep the house as clean as he wants now.

I've realized some of his cleaning demands are a bit intense. He picks up any piece of lint or hair that he finds on the carpet and gets annoyed if I don't notice strands of hair I've shed & accidentally left on the carpet.  He gets annoyed when I open the curtains and they're not equally pulled on each side. When I leave a couple books on a table, instead of in the bookshelf it's a problem. Months ago I spilled coffee on the rug in the kitchen and made a stain I immediately went to clean it up and he didn't even try to help, just watched me. He still brings it up to this day how he hates looking at the stain and I need to be more careful. Everyday I was on high alert, trying to anticipate what I may have done 'wrong', and trying to avoid him getting frustrated with me. He never yells at me or hurts me physically, but I'm discovering his constant watchful eye has made me an anxious wreck and has possibly contributed to my insecurities about myself.

Also - we Facetimed recently. The house is a mess! He says he's too busy with work to clean it, but he's never said such a thing before. I've never seen it so dirty, I didn't know he was capable of not cleaning 24/7. I wonder if it's a sign that his clean-freak tendencies were more about controlling me than controlling his environment?

I am feeling so stuck. After 7 years of emotional and verbal abuse, my husband finally admitted a few months ago that he had a problem.  It came off the back of an ultimatum I gave him- get help, or I walk. I only realized the full gravity of the situation myself about a year ago, but it took me that much time to process the emotions, accept that his behavior was abusive, and finally confront him. He found a therapist who has helped him understand his behavior and is working with him to get to the root of his abusive tendencies. He now agrees that he has been abusive, which is a massive relief. He has promised to work hard to be a better husband and has shown some signs of improvement.

Here's my problem. I don't love him anymore. My heart was broken long ago, and any love I may have felt for him is now gone. I don't hate him, and I think he is a good father to our toddler. We work well together as a team, so I could see us being good co-parents in the event of a divorce. And that's what I think I want- a divorce. I cannot be intimate with this person that I don't trust or romantically love, and it's not fair to him to string out our relationship when I know my heart cannot mend toward him. I feel extremely guilty because he has been putting in work to do better, but it's not enough. 

&#x200B;

I have all the things I need to leave- he understands that I can't stay, my family would be supportive, and I know my daughter would be in good hands when she wasn't with me. But that's the thing. I can't imagine not having my daughter with me every day. She's only two, and I was a stay-at-home mom for 18 months. She is my everything. He wants to split custody, which is fair because he is a good dad and she needs to see her father. But the idea of having her half the time breaks my heart so greatly and painfully that I haven't been able to pull the divorce trigger. I'd rather live in an unhappy marriage for 16 more years than go through this.

5234,Needing some clarity,"I’ve slowly realized and accepted over the last year that my husband has been mistreating me for years. I got the confirmation from our couples therapist last month that he is an emotional abuser. Now that I have an actual term for his behavior, I have been calling it out. It’s like a fog was lifted and his actions have lost their power. Of course, his behavior still hurts and sometimes I fall for his manipulations. I’ve been working up the courage to leave and today I reached a breaking point. I told him that I’m at a crossroads and don’t see our relationship improving. 

Here’s where I need some clarity. In response to that, my husband said I’m giving up on the marriage and that he’d never do that. He said I’m “just that kind of person”. I’ve been taking it hard, feeling guilty for wanting to leave even though he’s going to therapy and trying to do better. I did try for years to make him love me better, to be kinder. I feel selfish for choosing myself now. We have a daughter, so that means split custody and our whole lives upending. Because of me! 

Is his guilt trip a form of manipulation? In his moments of clarity he admits he drove me to this, that his behavior was abusive and unacceptable. But he always adds how I’m the kind of person to not try when the going gets tough. That he would never do this to his family. 

I’m sad, guilty, and wondering if I’m making the wrong choice. Part of me thinks, well of course you don’t wanna give up Husband, I’ve been a great partner! Imperfect, to be sure, with my own baggage and issues, but I never abused or mistreated you.

5236,Difficult Day,"I hate when I think I’m making progress and becoming a normal person and them WHAM, a trauma trigger hits. The last year of my marriage was rough. I was in a major depression and the word “ideation” appeared more than once in my medical chart. My husband, kept asking me why I wasn’t getting better or reminding me that all of my issues were in my head. He started talking about J - a woman we mutually knew in our circle but from afar. She’s gorgeous - athletic, smart, successful and I could think of at least a half dozen acquaintances that would beg to bed her - my then husband included. He started to compare me to J every day. Little comments like, “oh that’s what you’re wearing? Too band you don’t dress like J” or “I can’t believe you acted that way, why can’t you act like J?” Every day there was a reminder that I wasn’t enough - that I wasn’t her. Every day I heard her name and gave myself another reason to make ideation a reality. 

Fast forward to today. Now divorced, living 1600 miles away from the mess of the marriage and small town whispers of what happened to the seemingly happy couple. I’m chatting with a friend and he casually mentions J. Says nothing more than that she’s booked for his podcast. The name sent shivers down my spine. I was sitting at work and was shaking.

5239,Have therapists tried to diagnose you with BPD after opening up about your abuse?,"I’ve seen a couple of therapists in my life and opened up about my PTSD from my previous abusive relationships and gave details plus things I was going through with my current relationship that were similar to the past. Every time, the therapists ignored what I was telling them and said I had attachment issues and diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder. I always felt devastated because once again, ppl didn’t believe me and downplayed what I went through. With my current husband it was always “it sounds like you have communication issues” and due to my reactions that are caused by PTSD from abuse (self-harm, suicidal ideation), as well as having bipolar, that is all the proof they need to double down on their diagnosis. One psychiatrist said to me “you don’t want to bring your baggage from your last marriage into this one.”

Even if I do have BPD (which I highly doubt), there’s no acknowledgement of what I’ve been through. I was listening to a twitch stream one day and someone in the chat said that women who are domestic abuse survivors are often misdiagnosed with BPD because of the way they react to their PTSD triggers. Ppl wonder why I’m hesitant to go to therapy and this is why. 

Has anyone been through this? How were you able to receive the help you needed and deserved? How did you react when this happened to you?

5241,Therapy,"Y’all. Do any of you ever feel like you’re burning through “support” people in your life?

I find that I have very few “safe” people who I can trust to just be there for a mental hug when I need it. My marriage is a heavy burden, so I don’t expect anyone else to carry it all with me. I have 2 people I trust to be there to me, and even then I don’t want to burn them out by involving them in every up and down. So I’ve reached out to counselors…

1st marriage counselor broke trust when he contradicted his own advice in a major way. (He said “your husband is an Intimacy anorexic, here’s a DVD to watch with him about it.” Then when we came back as a couple, he said “oh your husband doesn’t have that…”  😳

2nd marriage counselor broke trust with me when he said I wasn’t experiencing abuse, and he wouldn’t use that word if it wasn’t every day. (If it was every single day, I’d be gone by now)

Pastors at my church have been terribly judging and unsupportive, sadly.

Now the only individual counselor I’ve ever had, who was doing a pretty good job at helping me feel supported, she started seeing my husband at our request so we could work towards couples counseling again. She’s giving me major red flags now. She told him his behavior is not abusive if it’s reacting to my emotions.

My husband says it’s not normal to go through counselors like this, and he’s worried I’m just not willing to listen to advice that I don’t like 😣

5242,"“You’re abusive, too”","Ok, so I know this a common response.

In my situation, I started raising my voice and yelling that “my feelings do matter,” after he told me that my feelings don’t matter. He proceeded to jump off the couch toward me, red in the face, yelling that would cause your throat to go raw… “get out of my f-ing house! Get out of my f-ing life!” I ran into the street barefoot because I was afraid.

So. He said his therapist says his behavior is not abuse because he was responding to me… he thinks it’s only abuse if it’s random, like he starts yelling at me when I’m doing the dishes, unprovoked.  Then he said that because I yelled, if I consider him abusive, then I’m abusive as well.

I told him that I was defending myself, I didn’t say a bad word about him, so it was different.

Can you help me process this? I need words to know why that’s wrong. Also, this therapist started as my therapist.

5243,Can the relationship heal?,"So the “bad things” have happened in the past… drunken rage and violence which have since stopped when he chose to be sober. He hasn’t called me terrible names in a few months or cursed at me (cu#t, fu&k you, etc). But the angry outbursts still happen… 

Two weeks ago I told him I wanted to separate. I was called the weakest person he knows, judgmental, too soft. I was called judgmental a few times later. Said he would kill himself if I left. How I ruin his day, etc. Last night, I “ruined his day” again.

We are currently on the “I’m sorry I will change” phase in the cycle of abuse. He finally agreed to marriage counseling (only AFTER I said I was leaving). Appointment hasn’t happened yet. 

But I feel like he never considers ME. Like when he apologizes, it’s never about ME. And I don’t think he’s capable of thinking something like, “oh, she would really like this or that” and doing something just for ME. No smiling for me; no apologizing for how something made me feel. And yet, THIS is the “good side” of the abusive cycle.

So when I feel like we’re breaking away from the negative, we are still neutral, as if we can’t progress into the positive sides of a marriage at all. So does it ever get better? Does counseling actually help? We have a baby together, otherwise I like to think I would have been long gone….

X

I was in a domestic abuse relationship/marriage for the better part of 10 years. I left with our daughter earlier this year - January 9th, to be specific. 

I still blame myself. What if it was all *my* fault? What if I deserved it? I yelled at him sometimes so surely I’m the bad guy here? He gaslit me so. Fucking. Much. My therapist is helping me see that. There’s so much to unpack. Maybe if I cleaned more. Maybe if I cooked him dinner more often (as his mother suggested I do so he would treat me nicer). Maybe if I didn’t try to be assertive and set boundaries. 

I know all of that doesn’t not excuse the abuse. There’s nothing a person can do to warrant abuse. 

I contacted the DV hotline at the end of December 2022 because I was not convinced I was being abused because others had it worse, surely? They told me I was. That is why I left. They plain cold hard truth told me that he was abusing me. Once he found out I contacted them, he immediately contacted them himself to tell them that I was also abusing him. They told him mutual abuse isn’t real. 

He has since been painting himself as a victim. He has his sister on his side - she calls me crazy and dramatic and that I need psychiatric help. 

Surviving is one thing. Healing is a whole other fucking ballgame. I should have left after the first year when he tried to kill/seriously injure me with a vehicle. 

I know I will get through this. I survived childhood abuse, I survived this. 

I’m just so tired. Thank you for listening if you read this.

5254,Having an extremely hard time dealing with leaving him.,"I’m so exhausted. I love this man so much, but I know I have to stop.

So all of these terrible things and yet I still miss him, I still miss sleeping next to him, but I know it’s just rose colored glasses. I just want to scream.

Oh and I don’t speak to my family, so no I can’t talk to them. I’m more than embarrassed to talk to my old friends, they all are just disappointed with how many times I’ve gone back to him, and they don’t believe me that I’m done with him now.

5255,Normal reaction to leaving an abusive marriage?,"Redditors,

I recently left a difficult relationship and moved into a new rental property, all within two weeks, a twenty year relationship and I am only 33. Yes that means we met in year 8 of highschool and we were inseparable, well at least I was to him, he was not anywhere near as loyal to me. Despite this I married him and had two children. The last incident tipped me over the edge, it was suicide or this.

At first, I felt strangely numb, like I couldn’t feel anything. But by the third day, I was hit with waves of anxiety, panic, guilt, and sadness that were almost overwhelming.

On top of the emotional turmoil, I’ve also been dealing with severe physical illness that I cannot attribute to any illness. I’ve been violently ill, vomiting daily, which has made this transition even more challenging. Sweating, shaking, vertigo, you name it. 

I’m wondering if others who’ve been through similar situations had a delayed emotional response like this while also experiencing the physical health issues. Is it common to feel this way after leaving, especially with the added stress on your physical well-being? How did you cope with both the emotional and physical aspects?

He allowed me to verbally be abused by his family. He took no responsibility when he was physically abusive- it was either my fault or didn’t happen. However, outside of our relationship he was such a giving person and kind to others. And we had a lot of romantic times for years. I really thought he was my person. We had a very deep connection though he is a very flawed human being.

I have been to therapy enough to know that being choked, pushed in front of my kids, threatened etc. is not okay.

I feel like this wouldn’t have happened to him with someone else and I am to blame.

She apologized for my wasted time and travel, but stated that due to him not showing up she had to dismiss the case and we would remain legally married. 

Then she said I could file a counter petition for the divorce, at no cost to me, other than to pay for him to be served. I have 30 days total to either do that or file in my state.

I'm not sure which direction to go but I may keep it in his state as the judge already is irritated with him and she is the same judge who previously handled the domestic violence petition that I had to file against him early in our marriage.

5284,Why is it always so exhausting dealing with an emotional abuser/narcissist?,"The roller coaster is “officially” starting the downward spiral. It’s been a year since everything happened, and he’s still completely oblivious to everything he did—he actually believes that he was in the right making the choices he did, and then expected me to just welcome him back with open arms (after I literally told him that wasn’t going to happen)!

I have been doing my best to stay NC with him because every time he texted me after we separated a year ago now (5/4/22), there was nothing he said that I wanted to or needed to respond to. He was in his “nice” stage until now because he was hoping that I would eventually respond to him—as if I would somehow realize he was “right” all along. 

I didn’t.

He’d text me every few weeks, telling me how much he missed me, etc., without response, for the past year hoping that I would tell him to come home.

I didn’t. 

He started texting me again last night at 2am, first telling me that I was being cruel to him by not responding to any of his messages—“do my vows mean nothing to me?” (says the man who broke every promise he’s ever made in 35 years of marriage).

Then another message came this morning, warning me that he’s getting impatient. 

Then came “the book” (a really long text; one paragraph, of course) a couple hours ago. He’s now threatening to “devastate me” in front our “whole family”. It seems he’s basically going to try to embarrass “the hell
out of me” because since I became disabled after having my last child 25 years ago, and unable to do everything that I could before, especially physically—he “suffered” because of it—so now I’m going to pay. 

He went on and on about how I was going to become destitute, that he’s going to change his name and disappear just so he can see me suffer. 

Our kids have been helping out with bills and such, since he left me holding all the financial responsibility. I lost my SSDI case due to bad doctors. Different and much longer story, but basically I wasn’t able to fight for myself, so I lost after fighting twelve years. 

Mr. “Hyde” is back. I had a year’s reprieve at least, right? Walking on eggshells, reactivated. 

He wonders why I haven’t responded to him? Seriously? Would you?

He’s given me 24 hours to respond to his 4pm text, “or else”. What should I do? I don’t think I can contact APS until Monday to see how I can protect myself? (He left the state before we could file a restraining order the last time). I don’t know if it’s something I should bother them with?

5292,Police won't file a report,"Hopefully this is the right place to post this. Basically I was in an abusive relationship (marriage) for 4 years. We were married for almost 5 but things had been going on for only 4 years. Over the course of 4 years he was only physically violent maybe 10 times. It ranged from getting choked, slapped, shoved, to getting punched in the face. We also have moved around quite a bit from different states and different areas of the same state. I have documented some stuff with photos, screenshots, and writing things down as I remember them. The most recent incident was in October of 2022, and after this incident I was finally honest with my friends and family and they helped me get out. I'm staying with my parents now so I am safe. It took me probably the last 6 months to process what happened over the last 4 years and I did a lot of thinking and going back and forth if filing a police report was the right thing to do because 1. I was scared 2. His family is in the local government and I was worried about retaliation and 3. I was honestly embarrassed.  I finally got the nerve to report the most recent thing to the police yesterday and I went with my evidence and told them everything and their response was that they would not file a report because it would be a waste of everyone's time.

5301,My husband doesn't want his money to go for my dental care.,"  My husband (DH) and I have been waiting for the income tax refund check to come in, which it finally did last week. My DH promised me that he would allow me to get my teeth fixed (they are breaking off and chipping off) because I can't eat since they're so bad.
  Background: I had a stroke back in 2015-2016 and I was bedridden for 4 years and fell into a deep depression, so dental hygiene shamefully wasn't on my mind, much less a priority.

  We get the money, and we're both required to sign the check, but only because the tax return is in both of our names. During our entire 14 year marriage, the money has always been ""his"", just like the house is ""his"", too. He promised to give me $1,000 out of the $6,500 we're getting.

  Anyway, he starts giving me the usual BS: Withholding the money he promised to give to me, delaying giving me the money for as long as possible, etc. Now he's saying that he has ""more important things to do"" with the money than spending it on my broken, chipping, and rotting teeth. 

  I feel financially, mentally, and physically abused, but I cannot leave because I have nothing, plus my 15 year old autistic son needs to stay in the same school until he graduates in 2025.
  I have a seizure disorder and I cannot work outside of the house, plus I have Multiple Sclerosis. I definitely feel stuck.

5303,Feeling Guilty About Pressing Charges,"A couple of days ago, my husband strangled me and had 2 of his firearms fully loaded pressed to my dog's head threatening to kill him . I originally went to the police department to have a Keep the Peace Standby to grab as much of my belongings, and the officers saw the strangulation marks on my neck. They said that they had to press charges against him regardless of me wanting to or not. They then questioned me about what happened and then I told them in detail of what occurred. They then asked more questions about an incident that occurred a couple weeks ago where my husband purposely crashed his truck with me inside, which he left abandoned since it was totaled. He lied to them when they came to the house the day of to ask about what had happened, which he stated  he clipped a deer. They didn't believe him due to the damage of the truck. After taking pictures of my injuries and having me write down a statement, over 5 police officers came to the house to let me grab my belongings. My husband wasn't there. In fear of retaliation, I got a temporary restraining order while I was at the women's shelter. 

But after all of this and several other instances of physical abuse, I feel extremely bad and guilty. I just wanted to grab my stuff and leave to go back to my family. He has 5 kids from his previous marriage and is the only one that financially supports them since his previous wife died. He has currently been charged with 2 felonies and has been arrested. He has already posted bail. I can't drop the charges because it's the state charging him, not me. I love him even with all of this happening and I miss him.

5304,"Lawyer, mom, and heartbroken","My abuser fired his lawyer and has been using mine for all of his questions. I asked my lawyer if we can just stop answering his questions. 

We agreed to be faithful until the divorce. He won’t say he has a girlfriend but I found a note thanking him for a great night on his counter when I was at his place after he asked for a booty call. 

Every time I hear from my lawyer about his questions it’s a punch in the gut. I’m sure he wants a copy of the separation to show his girlfriend. 

My heart is broken. How can he move on so quickly after 10 years? I didn’t mean anything to him? He needs to stop reaching out to my children. I need to not have to hear his name every day. 

I’m not ready to date. He promised he’d love me forever. He always lies. Always. Is his indifference real or just to hurt me? He cheated throughout our marriage, why can’t I hurt him?

My mom broke up with her booty call of 6 months who she was talking to men behind his back and calls me crying every night. She wasn’t concerned about me when I was strangled and losing my husband. She wants me to comfort her over a relationship she disrespected and ended, she broke up with him because he wasn’t cute enough. She started reading about DV (she didn’t care to learn for me) and says he may have been love bombing her because he mowed her lawn.

He hit me in 2020 and then a month ago went a little farther when I didn’t do what he told me to. If I can get another two years in, I can probably complete my financial and other stability goals. 


In the past month, he has gone to a counseling session for DV perpetrators and is avidly reading a book on anger management. I’m already seeing him start to recognize when he gets too angry and he’s following the book’s advice to back off for six seconds and do some grounding. 


I’m not thinking rationally right now. I am aware that I’ve literally experienced the escalation I’m always reading about on the Internet, but I’m just hoping that a two year gap between major incidents means something for the timing of the near-inevitable third time.

5314,Does anyone else cling to their evidence?,"I was in an abusive marriage from 19-22. But since it was my first serious relationship I didn’t realize what it was until I was out. Which means when it came time to file for a restraining order due to harassment, I only had evidence of the social media stalking , not the abuse. That was in 2019. 
I then ended up in another abusive relationship for 2021. That time I realized what was happening and knew that I would need proof. So I filmed almost everything. I wasn’t smart enough to realize he’d never stop, but I was smart enough to know that I would need proof if things ever got to the point of no return ( don’t worry I’m in very intense trauma therapy and we’re working on the obv. Codependency and abandonment issue) 
However. Both cases have been completed. I will no longer have to face either of them. But I cannot get rid of my evidence. I have binders , private photo albums, witness statements, all saved to multiple sources. I don’t intend on anyone seeing them, or using them again. But I cannot seem to allow myself to purge the evidence. I’m terrified I will need it one day and I won’t have it.

5315,Never regret leaving!,"Ten months ago today, I left a marriage that was physically, emotionally, financially, and physiologically abusive.

He would fat-shame me and then scream at me if I didn’t clean my plate. He would act supportive of my medical issues and then tell me how he was sick of me being sick. He would open idk credit cards and take out loans in my name only, and then “let me know” afterwards - only to go berserk if I tried to bring up ways to save money. He would hit me and then tell me I deserved it because I was the one who made him so angry. This is just the tip of the iceberg of what I endured for almost seven years.

Having grown up in a loving house, I had no idea this type of evil existed in the world. It was the members of that loving house and my friends who saved me 10 months ago and have been supporting me ever since. I honestly believe I would be dead if they had not gotten me out.

I couldn’t believe it as I read it now, months after I’ve been out, but I realize how blind I was and how I continuously justified my husband’s behavior. And for what???

5318,"The small abuses are often overlooked, but just as traumatizing","Lately, I've been thinking about the little things he did. I've only explained the big stuff to people and never get to talk about the little things. The day to day abuse. One thing that stands out to me is the toilet. 

He would destroy the toilet and never clean it. I was a young wife, so I didn't have a ton of experience cleaning a toilet after a man used it. I assumed the mess was normal, but I would talk to him about it and let him know there was pee under the seat and that he wasn't aiming correctly. When I say it was disgusting, it was destroyed. Stuff under the lid and on the rim and sometimes outside the bowl. He would never clean it. One day, he mocked me and told me he pisses poorly on purpose so I would have to clean it. He would say horrible degrading stuff to me all the time. I would beg him to please clean it himself, and he never did. 

After he moved out, I have never experienced that so I know it's true that he did that on purpose. My now ex-boyfriend practically lived with me, and the toilet was never disgusting after he used it. 

I hate that these small abuses cause intrusive thoughts. I can't stop thinking about them. The small ways he would degrade me. I'm also hurt that no one supports me. No one did a single thing to stop him. After he moved out, my neighbor told me that she would cry because she would hear him screaming at me and never heard me yelling. She never called the police. Why? 

Only the YWCA and the police/courts  helped me. My entire family abandoned me during my marriage, and were nasty to me after too.

5322,Needing Support,"Sorry for long post.
 I have a 2 year old daughter and a boy on the way. I have been with my husband for just over 10 years, but married almost 4. Since I had my daughter,  I had really bad PPD and PPA, then covid hit shortly after, which cause other issues. Things got worse in our marriage and of course I am blamed for it all, which causes more anxiety and worsens my condition,  especially being pregnant now. I was even told he would leave me if I didn't get pregnant again, then when we found our, he threatened it again and multiple times since. But other times, he's already pushing for a third, when he said if it was a boy, he wouldn't ask anymore. People have noticed that he has become a narcissist,  mentally and emotionally abusive, but uses those terms against me. That he is the victim here and has to deal with my mental issues. Yells at me and does it in front of my daughter.  I know what I need to do and taking steps in doing so, but scared because I am pregnant as well and feel like I can't do this on my own and have no family here. I am making sure all things are in place before the official file because I want to make sure everything works out, because I know he is going to use my mental illness against me. He calls me worthless,  a monster, a horrible mother, etc., many times saying he doesn't want to be with the person I have become. And yes, I am in therapy. He doesn't believe in it and refuses to do marriage counseling and saying things would get better if I fix myself. He is also very gross when it comes to some things like not washing hands or just uses water after changing poopy diapers or dealing with raw meat, thus some of my issues. I try to talk to him about it and get told nothing is on there, he is not gonna change, the world hasn't changed I have and need to get over it, etc. His mom sees it too and won't say anything.  I try to talk to her about it, but if course she sweeps it under the rug or says it's just his frustration with me. He now has been starting to throw things as well, not at us, but just in general among other things.

5326,"DV, OFP, & Divorce Questions","I filed and was granted an ex parte OFP for my husband of 16 years (it’s been off and on all kinds of abuse. Had ex parte before but could still not get away, it’s a long story). 

He got a family law lawyer and then I got a criminal law lawyer. He requested hearing dates in a letter to the judge and pushed it off a few weeks (ex parte since 23rd of May). He violated the OFP a few times (third party contact and driving past the house really slow and he is suppose to stay a mile away-there’s no need to drive through. We live in the sticks). 

My lawyer wanted to use the violations as leverage to get him to sign OFP for 2 years or until dissolution of the marriage before the court date or we file criminal charges. Husband sent divorce papers instead so I got a divorce lawyer too.

He did this with the last OFP, then called from a different number and said he hadn’t paid my car payment and if I go to hearing, my car would get towed and we had 3 babies at the time under age 5.

What do you guys think the odds are of this working to escape domestic violence again? Anyone went through this?

Finally was able to have the courage to serve a TPO against my STBXH. He has some mental issues (undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenia or bc of his longterm drug use) with substance abuse history. Im sure hes also depressed and cant keep up with jobs. Hes progressed worse than ever; ever since our baby was born. He beat me up pretty bad (the worst he’s ever) and I decided that I need to do what’s best for me and our 14 month old. To leave. He can get help or his family can deal with it.

Relationship wise we are married for 10 yrs going on 11.  His parents culturally cant seem to admit he did any wrong (we’re all Asian )… actually Im more angry right now at his family than the abuser himself. Bc clearly he needs help. (Trying not to care but hes still my kids dad.. 🙄) 

The judge says he is probably doing meth and that damaged his brain. 

Either way. If he shows up (or not shows up) to the court date for the protection order, can he still be arrested? Because well obviously he beat me up pretty bad and put our son in danger?

I’m really shaken up because he’s been calling me names all day (stupid, motherf*cker, ugly to name a few). And I have been telling him all day not to swear or call me names anymore. He’s been doing nothing but trying to convince me I’m the one that’s wrong and that I need to make it up to him. And when he called me stupid motherf*cker in the middle of me telling him that I just want him to stop saying that, I had enough and tried to leave. Which made him scream in my ear as loud as possible (I could feel his teeth rub against my ear), and proceed to shove me, man handle me, hit my shoulder, and then finally throw a gas can he found in the garage as hard as he can at me.

I’m really shocked. 
I thought that maybe he would text me telling me sorry or something along those lines, but all I got was a text asking me where I was. And then nothing. I’m not going to respond because he’s made it clear he doesn’t care. 
I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to involve police, but I don’t want to go back because I know he will verbally berate me and try to make me think it’s my fault.

I don’t want to leave, I want my marriage to work, but it really really hurts because he doesn’t want to admit any wrong doing on his part, and if he does he quickly addresses it and then will blow up at me if i try to get more out of him.

He's really testing my determination to leave. Once the kids are in bed he starts serious conversations about how he can improve and whether or not I ""really"" need to move out.

My husband and I have been together for 20 years. For the past 8-10 years he's had a lot of toxic behavior and very covert emotional abuse. The thing is we mostly had a good marriage. 

I left him once and he convinced me he wasn't abusive. It wasn't hard. He didn't call me names or hit me, it was much more subtle.

I left him in November and went to a dv shelter for 3 months because we got into a bad argument and he slammed on the brakes in the middle of the road to get out and walk. My head hit the windshield and spiderwebbed it and I ended up with a concussion and a husband so lost in rage and then self pity he didn't even realize or care I got hurt right away. Then when he did it was all poor him he's a POS.  We did counseling together and separate and we've been back together for about 3 months. 

I'm that time we've had 2 really bad arguments. The first one he wouldn't stop arguing and coming at me (with words) until I literally almost lost my mind. I started screaming and crying, hyperventilating and begging him to stop. He violated my boundaries when he wouldn't stop when I asked multiple times before losing it. I tried to defuse the situation. It didn't work.

Recently we had an argument and again he wouldn't let me end the argument when I wanted to take a break til the next day or our therapy day. He gave me ultimatums that I had to talk that night or we wouldn't be talking at all. Then he used passive aggressive technique to make me feel bad and give in to continuing the argument so we could solve it and he'd feel better. It got worse and then he said the worst thing he said "" I might as well be your rapist with how bad you make me out to be""

He thinks the argument started because I can't deal with him being grouchy around me. 

I struggle because it's very very hard to see him as an abuser and he sees himself as a recovered abuser. But if accidents and arguments where he has no respect for my feeling or emotions happen more then what choice so I have. I want to work on our marriage but I'm not sure if it's salvageable.

I'm also a sahm with both physical and mental health problems. So nowhere to go, no job ,no money.

Is there any hope if him ever changing? Sometimes I wonder if I'm just printing the inevitable.

5342,I finally left my abuse exhusband,"I(26f) just recently left my husband (26m) of five years. In 2019 I was sexually assaulted by a customer at my job and ever since then my marriage began to deteriorate. 
I shut down and I know it was hard for my husband to watch. I became less physically intimate and it took a toll on him. One day he snapped. He locked me in a room and began screaming and yelling at me about how he had suffered and how I needed to be grateful for his sacrifices. 
After that day I shut him out. I believe that is the day I truly began to hide myself from him. As time went on we both made regrettable decisions. And the marriage began to slowly fall apart. In January of 2021 a fight escalated and he ended up assaulting me. He was convicted of Assault and Battery on a family member and I just couldn't find the courage to leave him at that time.
Over the next two years I became isolated. Hiding my feelings even more so. And his anger only grew until he finally exploded for the second time. He wanted to argue with me one day and I wouldn't engage. I went to leave and he picked me up and threw me against a wall. I told him he needed to leave and he punched a hole through our livingroom window. I left the house and went to work after that. My coworkers learned of the incident and encouraged me to press charges, but I couldn't bring myself to do it at the time. His behavior became more irratic and I eventually pressed charges and a protective order was put in place. Part of the protective order was that he could not turn off the power to the house because it was only in his name and he refused to let me have the account info to pay the power bill and the mortgage (which is only in his name). Come to find out months later that he has not paid the mortgage since and is trying to let the house forclose so I don't get it in the divorce. I have a mortgage company set up to by the house out of foreclosure, but I having issues scrapping up the money. I'm terrified that I'll loose my place to live and even more terrified that our son will lose a place to live. I just don't know what to do. All of this is crippling me and I know I need to stay strong.

5347,early signs?,"
hey everyone

I’m not sure if I’m in an abusive relationship or not. My therapist says I am, though he’s never physically hit me. We’re 25 and today was an awful awful day. tl;dr

one of the worst days of my life. he threw glasses, a plate, hit himself repeatedly and threatened to hit me. he accidentally got the side of my face with a hand towel, but that was the only time i was touched and it was a hand towel. he said ""you should have been beaten more as a kid then you would know when to shut up"" and ""all I want to do is punch you"". it was all so horrible. he was screaming in my face a centimeter from my face with spit flying in my face. I was crying and he belittled me for it, saying “I don’t want to hear you cry”.

I’ve been dealing with coping with his emotional cheating for the last six months. I’ve only talked to my therapist about it and I’ve felt so alone trying to heal from it. I brought up marriage counseling today in light of my seeing that he was talking to another girl today. Not “hey how are ya” but “You’re glowing, You’re so pretty,” etc etc. Another “just friend”. And when I brought up marriage counseling he became irate, saying “that’s for failing marriages, we’re too early in our relationship for that. You can’t force someone to go. We can resolve this on our own.” I’m not forcing, but it’s so hurtful that he doesn’t want to work on this in a constructive setting. 

then, when i felt like we needed to talk, he invited our friends over and when i felt upset about that he called them and said “she’s being weird. i think she thinks there’s something weird going on between the three of us.” meaning him and the two girls (lesbian couple) 

I don’t. It was so embarrassing and hurtful, I’m private and like to resolve my problems privately. He likes to vent, quite publicly. It’s very very hurtful. Because they have no idea the full picture of what’s been happening. 

I guess, in a very very long winded way, what might the early warning signs of an emotionally or physically abusive relationship look like?

5364,Question,"I left my husband a bit over a year ago and have been going over some things that happened in our relationship.  There’s one event I keep thinking about and I’m not sure if it was SA or not. 

He was my first serious relationship and, even though I was in my mid-20s, i was a virgin and didn’t sleep with him until three months before we marriage. We only dated for 11 months and about 5 months in we started mucking about with oral and stuff, but I was still very new to it all. 

At friend’s dinner party He was telling them how we don’t have sex but we muck about and I was joking about it and but feeling a bit uncomfortable he had told them. Anyway I got really drunk that night and I remember passing out when we were getting out of the spa, and then I remember waking up in bed and he was going down on me and then when I came round again he was pushing his d into my mouth. I remember  feeling confused but also sorry that I was too drunk to do anything for him coz i I was so friggin in love with him. 

The next day I didn’t feel good about what happened and i asked if it had happened and he said ‘yeah you were saying all this stuff before we went to bed that was making me so horny and then you couldn’t do anything’ and I *apologised*. 
This incident never sat right with me and recently it’s been popping into my head a lot. Coz I kinda feel that it wasn’t right that he tried to get me to give him oral when I was almost paralytically drunk. And I kinda feel like I excused it coz we were together and it was stuff we were doing anyway.

5367,In a highly functional marriage with a depressed person that has fits of rage—don’t know what to do.,"I️ am married to a man who is highly successful but has severe issues with depression and rage. This rage has come and gone throughout the 5 years in our marriage. There has definitely been some physical, verbal, and sexual abuse. During periods of lows, it is miserable and in moments of momentary peace, there is a lot of self hatred on his end because he can’t look at me without remembering what he’s done to me and falling back into his depression (he’s not willing to seek help, or increase his medication). 

I️ feel trapped because I️ no longer work and I have basically spent our marriage managing his life,  helping him with his work, and making financial decisions for us both. We legitimately make a great team; as an outsider people think our relationship is perfect—because we spend a lot of time together. We legitimately enjoy each other’s company when we are doing things outside of the home and are alone.

I have no girl friends of my own (I’ve always been a solitary and private person—it has never bothered me until now, I️ feel like I️ need someone to talk to). I have a supportive family; but they are not aware of any of this (I️ feel like I️ can’t give them this burden). His family knows a bit of the situation and was very appalled to begin with, but have slowly turned their backs on it and encourage me to be extremely positive with him so he can come out of his depression. I️ try, but there’s only so much positivity I️ can give when someone tells you that are worthless and then apologizes 20 minutes later and tells you they don’t mean it. It’s very confusing and leaves me feeling like I️ don’t know what’s real anymore. 

I️ am angry with myself for telling his family anything at all, because I️ realize that no matter what they say, in the end they will always be on his side. 

I’m incredibly lonely, I still love this man, want nothing more than for him to be healthy, but I️ know this is an issue. I’ve always been a smart and (what people would consider) attractive woman— I’m self aware to know that I’m being codependent, have a little ptsd, and am ashamed that I’m not strong enough to block out the negativity. I️ am also insecure about leaving the lifestyle which I️ have helped build.

5370,Healing from an abuse,"I'm an abuse survivor of mentally and physically abuse by my mom. Until today she would do the same thing of using money and using guilt to get and give her money. Even though she would use the money to let my brother use it for anything he needs.

I'm getting out of abusive marriage. 7 years of abusive marriage. He would pick on me. Make me feel bad when he did something good. Getting angry on a daily basis. I was pretty living on an egg shells. He cheated as well. I only found out one of them. He would treat others woman with love and compassion, I was his punching bag when he had a bad day. I took care of him. Focus on him and make sure he got taking care of. I worked couple jobs. Tried to get my nursing degree (which I dropped out, because I wasn't able to focus on school. Because I'm doing so much). I did everything for house chores. He wasn't grateful about it. He would pick on me and I drained myself. Finally had multiple major depression because I can't do it anymore. I finally felt numb, because he told me to do all this other things. When I finally about to do it. He said no that I'm doing it wrong. Getting angry. I don't know how many times he threatened me with divorce or with some other things. finally got out in December. We tried to work it out, my feelings and energy is just not there anymore.

I finally have a stable life. I'm trying to get my life back on track. For some reason, when my life feel stable. All this trauma came back at me. I know it's been almost 10 months, I started having nightmares and super bad anxiety and panic attack on my daily basis. I'm so exhausted because I can't let my feeling just be exist because I know people surrounding me will think that I'm being crazy.

I wonder if anyone experiencing the same thing? When life finally stabilize and your trauma hunting you. Even with a small activity that reminded me time with my ex and my mom. I would get the chill and have this guilt feeling that endlessly there. And I would just get super exhausted. I don't have energy to do anything. I'm still hoping I can still work, because I can't afford not to have a job right now.

5371,Why I hate guns,"I just got triggered by something I saw online. A man was pointing a gun in a crying woman face, and when confronted by another man he said 'I'm just waving a gun around, I ain't touch her' implying hes not hurting her cuz he didnt hit her. 
That's so wrong. 
I remember waking up to my ex, rocking on the edge of the bed, clutching a loaded gun and talking about he should just 'do it'. I remember falling asleep knowing there was a loaded gun less than a foot from my head and wondering if I was gonna wake up in the morning, or if my ex would shoot himself. From day to day it changed. 
I remember the utter terror of waking up to see my precious 2 year old sucking on the business end of a loaded gun, remember the awful fight that ensued. Remember the gun being pointed at my face again and again, being laughed at when I'd get upset. I was so  'silly to think he'd do it'. When I tried to leave it was threats of blowing off his head, of shooting himself if I tried to leave. 

That is abuse. That is trauma. Making someone fear for their life repeatedly, making them fear for YOUR life repeatedly is abuse.

I laid awake crying so many nights, afraid to sleep because I thought I would wake up to my ex dead on the floor. I was scared going to work because I was terrified my child might find their father dead when they woke and I wasn't there. 

I still have anxiety around guns, I still have nightmares of him rocking on the bed, him screaming through the night and remember each detail of that gun like a fine peice of art. 

Sorry I needed to rant this out. I never talk about that part, even my boyfriend knows some of it but not all of it. I dont know how to explain that sense of terror and failure. To explain why I stayed in such a toxic situation as long as I did when people ask. 
My ex is my biggest shame, the abuser I chose myself, the one I tried to fix. Literally the only good thing that came from that marriage is my child.

He started talking about our finances, and I was floored. He was saying that I got us into debt early in our marriage, and he worked to get us out... when the reality was that HE had debt when we got together, and he talked me into refinancing the home that I owned in order to take care of his debt. When I said this, he flew off the handle screaming no, no, no, and completely denying that was what went down. He went on a rant about how I have bad money skills and have spent recklessly during the time we were married and said that he should have a bigger share of our savings because he had to deal with my bad financial choices. It was just insane. When I asked for details, he just started attacking me personally (which is what he does).
I am really afraid of settling the divorce because I know he's going to be as unreasonable and as hurtful as possible.

I was still so confused though- why would anyone lie about their spouse like that, and to such an extreme extent? Only through therapy did I realize that he has been manipulating and brainwashing me for the entirety of our 10 year marriage. I've unraveled so many lies and so much verbal abuse. I always accepted his verbal abuse as ""constructive criticism"" because he's such a ""good guy"". His mask is all charming, charismatic, good guy deception. I always accepted his supply sources as platonic friendships because he's a ""good guy"" and therefore would never cheat. I always accepted the many, many red flags in our relationship as anything but red because he's a ""good guy"". As soon as I realized he isn't the good guy he presents as in public, everything became glaringly obvious. 

But now he's effectively isolated me so much that all of my friends (""our"" friends) have been manipulated by him to believe I'm crazy. They of course trust that he's such a good guy he would never lie to them.

But I am the one that is splitting our family up and destroying everything. He doesn’t understand just how much I hurt. That I had to do this so maybe it will get better. Doesn’t he know that things were so bad that I needed to destroy the life I was living in for decades? I wish he could see the bigger picture. But he only has his version of it. The happy family of 6. With some ups and downs along the way. Not the way we all had to tiptoe around him. Not the way he made me feel so bad. Not the severe anxiety I got every pay period when we were negative. Knowing he spend $500 on in app purchases. But I couldn’t tell him to stop because of the so very many times when I tried I was met with “it’s my money, I can do what I want with it”It was worse than that but I am sure you know what I am talking about. He just doesn’t know. I  wanted a friend. I wanted someone I could trust. I didn’t have either. I didn’t want this type of marriage. I tried keeping it good. I gave everything I had. It wasn’t good enough. I needed it to stop. Now I am left trying to figure out how to function because I am not sure how to. I am stuck in emergency mode.

5391,Turns out I never knew him,"My (35f) husband (35ftm) had been back and forth on whether he wanted to continue our marriage for the last year and a half. 

Married for 6.

Every month or every other he'd question things, typically wondering aloud whether I was the one for him for several reasons - two of the main being I did not want to carry children but was open to any other means of having a family, and that he possibly wanted someone more feminine. 

I stayed. I asked him to stay. I tried like hell every single time to find a way to keep us working and growing. I thought I was succeeding. 

Three weeks ago he propositioned me to buy land and a new home. 

A week after that he talked with me about adoption and cost. 

That same day he told me our relationship was his first choice, and we planned to get individual and couples support. 

That same night he did shrooms with a friend. Things were never the same. 

Two days later he ended our relationship abruptly. Told me he saw his destiny and I'm not the one in it. That he wants someone more feminine to have a family with and that if I were the one then he'd continue to work but I'm not so there's no need. 

I've only spoken to him a handful of times, when he needs something. Two weeks later and I've been completely removed from his social media. 

Tonight I found out he'd downloaded Grindr & Growlr within the past couple of months, when things were good between us. But, I'm not feminine enough. 

There's no rhyme or reason for any of this, for his behaviors, aside from an empty person trying to fill an impossible internal void. I suppose I'm just sharing my story. I feel worthless and disposable. I knew something was off early in the relationship but I ignored my intuition, and here I am.

I had to cut him off 6 months ago for the sake of my sanity, only to find out just 2 weeks ago that he died of a heart attack. Im in complete turmoil. I still loved him with all my heart. Our relationship was very complicated and the last thing I said to him was that he’ll never see me again. I feel terrible for saying that and I’m struggling to find peace. He made sure that I was kept very separate from his family and friends and I can only imagine that over the 10 years he had conditioned them to believe that the problems in our relationship were all my fault. I know he wouldn’t of told the truth because the truth would bring shame on him and he never admitted to being wrong. His brother has told me that it’s ‘family only' allowed to visit him in the chapel of rest, even though we’d been together 10 years!… some marriages don’t even last that long. I desperately needed to see him, to kiss him on the head and to tell him Im sorry that I wasn’t there at the end, but I honestly didn’t know this would happen. I feel like he’s screwed me over one last time. I really need to speak with him, I’m desperate to hear that he’s sorry for everything he put me through. I always felt so misunderstood in the relationship and I’m hoping he will now be remorseful and can see how pure my heart really is. But I worry that his narcissism will still exist, because if it’s does then he’s probably taking pleasure in seeing me suffer.

5412,I’ve officially hit my limit,"I’ve officially had enough with my narcissistic husband (34).


He has yelled at me almost daily for something dumb. Every single holiday, event, special thing that has happened has been ruined over a dumb fight/ anger spell on his end.
This Christmas Eve, he threatened divorce because I turned the heat up to 67 degrees. Christmas Day he was sweet, but then the day after it was the same whip lash as always, he woke up angry, ignored me all day, then yelled at me saying this was the ‘worst relationship ever and I’m a horrible partner’ because I ‘blocked his view’ from the tv.

I’ve been trying the ‘gray rock’ method the past few months as he hears no reason and just finds reasons to be upset no matter what. This has now resulted in him calling ME a narcissist and saying I’m a bad partner.
I have tried everything to make this work and it’s literally impossible.

I have been so sick, and unfortunately found out I was pregnant.
I immediately started crying when the doctor told me.
Got home, told him, and he immediately starts making it about himself, saying ‘I’ve destroyed this relationship’ and that this should be a happy moment for HIM.!

I then told him I’d be getting an abortion and will be moving out as soon as I feel better.

I cannot believe I have wasted so much time with this a$$hole.
I’m 27 years old and feel like I have ruined my entire life.
Now I’ll have had an abortion, and will have a divorce in my cards before the age of 30, and will be living with my mother.

Just wanted to write this- maybe someone will see this and choose to get out before they hit the absolute rock bottom.

<EDIT ADD>

I wanted to thank everyone here for taking the time to comment- I’ve come back to this post and have read all of these comments multiple times.

It’s been an insanely dark/challenging week- and my ‘partner’ has made a horrible time in life even worse.

This morning he yelled at me because I had to log on to work.. and my office is in the bedroom and he was sleeping (at 9:15am on a work day- oh yeah and of course he gets the extra room for HIS office).

I have made plans to move next week, it’s really hard, and really sad. But I just keep telling myself that if he truly loved me I would not be treated like this.

Seriously.. what kind of person tries to bring someone lower at a terrible time in life? Oh yeah! That’s right, narcissists.

I’ll be alone, but atleast I won’t be lonely in a  volatile marriage anymore.

5413,No support by my narc husband,"The day before Thanksgiving I lost a close paternal uncle. I was there for the holiday to spend a week with them. He was on hospice at home, we knew he'd be gone by Christmas but he went pretty quick. I posted something on fb about him passing and my narc husband found out about it. I broke his rule (he has several for me) and so he chose (while I was still with my widowed aunt)to end our marriage. He woke me up after coming home late and told me our 33 year long marriage was over. It was a rough time for me. I've endured the silent treatment and his nastiness to me ever since. About 2 weeks ago I found out that my maternal uncle had 6 weeks to live.  He just died tonight. My husband overheard me talking to family so I got up and went outside to talk for privacy. I came back in shut the bedroom door and silently cried my eyes out. Not one time did he come in and check on me, not one time did he ask if I was okay, or can I get something for you? How?? Why??? I'm honestly not sure how much more I can take at this point. I've lost 2 uncle's and a marriage in a little over a months time.  Honestly I would just love to punch him in the face.  I feel guilty for feeling that way. I would appreciate encouragement and prayers right now. Thank you.

5415,“Respect”,"I recently found this sub & it’s making me feel some sense of sanity for which I am grateful. 

Just curious if this is just a thing with my narc husband or if it’s a universal experience….

He will constantly take any little thing I say or do & exaggerate it to the point where he says I’m being “disrespectful”. Any time I’m showing emotions in front of family or in public I’m “disrespecting” him & I’m an “embarrassment”.

For example, yesterday we went with my BIL to get some coffee. The drive thru line was a weird one where you merge from 2 lines into 1. Another car got upset with my husband for what he thought was jumping him in line. He started an altercation where the guy & my narc were arguing with each other & it was so embarrassing. I ended up telling the guy in the car that he could go in front of us, because I wanted to keep the peace & it was super embarrassing. When my husband rolled up the windows, he unleashed on me & said I was being an embarrassment & was very “disrespectful” for telling that man he could go ahead. He said i should have just ducked down& let him handle it like a man. He yelled at me for about 20 minutes over a drive thru… He said awful things, saying I “better not do that ever again!”. Saying I have to let him be the man & handle it. I am an embarrassment. All of this happened in front of his brother.  I cried in front of my bil, & felt super weak that my narc felt comfortable enough to verbally abuse me in front of his brother. I was the one who had to apologize for this situation, my husband now refuses to look or talk to me. 

This was rather mild compared to normal instances but I’m just over it. It makes me feel crazy & hopeless. I’m not sure how much longer

5422,What’s wrong? What’s the news? What’s that look?,"These are the questions my husband asks me daily. My phone chimes ( from across the room) he says, “who’s that?” Like how am I supposed to know?? Then when I pick it up, before I even get the screen opened he asks, “ what’s wrong?” I reply with, “nothing”, then he says after I put my phone down, “ what’s the news?” At this point I never tell him exactly what the message is because good or bad it will always be something in a form of a negative attack on whatever it was. Then after I reply he will then ask, “ what’s that look” and I am not sure what he is getting at on that one because I stay blank faced just so he doesn’t question me and he still does. 
   For the first 4 or so years of our marriage I used to share everything with him, then I noticed how detailed he wanted me to tell him every part of the discussion I had with my adult kids. Every time I would tell him he always had something negative to say about them, then I was always trying to validate what was actually going on and trying to explain to him in the best and easiest way that I could that he wasn’t understanding. My attempts never ever worked. If I told him my daughter was being promoted to a new position, he would go on how hard it all will be and how I will never get to see her because she won’t have time to come by for me anymore. Another example is my oldest son, which has had the hardest time with employment, which I believe is how my husband has treated him messed him up in the head some. Anyway, I can say my son got a new job, his reply will always be,” don’t expect him to keep it long, that kid is so lazy, if it wasn’t for me helping him out with a car he would have a car.” He will just go on and on putting him down.

5423,Hoovering," 
I'm just so annoyed. I was mentally, physically, and spiritually drained. He has put me through so much this year. I thought he was my person. He wanted a divorce out of the middle of nowhere two months right after we got married while I was pregnant. He told me if I kept the baby, he wouldn't be in our Child's life. I decided to agree to the divorce and have an abortion. 2 months later, he begged me to give us another chance. I decided to try because we got married, and I don't believe in divorce, and he used God and counseling to save our marriage. We go to counseling for him to manipulate the therapist and tell me he wants a divorce. I found out that I was pregnant again. He told me I shouldn't have a baby with someone who is not going to talk to me. And a month later texts me like nothing happened. I ignore him. We started our divorce proceedings, and after meeting with the judge, we could've gotten our divorce on the next court date. He told the judge he didn't want a divorce anymore, instead an annulment. Judge wipes the floor with him. I had to make a counter-complaint, or he had to the annulment first. He never does anything. I think he just wanted me to back out of the divorce. We have been going to court, and he has been non-compliant, not filing paperwork. The judge asked us more than once if we wanted a divorce. We have a court with the magistrate. He misses it.  He blames him for missing court on me because I didn't remind him. He was the one who filed and started the divorce proceedings. He texts me like nothing has happened and we will get through this. He wants to have phone sex with me.  He is sorry. He still has no idea nor cares to ask about my pregnancy, which resulted in a miscarriage. I'm so over him I blame myself because it really takes 2 people. I forgive him because I know he is a narcissist he can't help himself.

5429,Seeking Guidance and Support in Challenging Times,"Hello everyone,

Over the past year, my journey has been filled with challenges. I've been married for one year to my husband, whom I've known for four years. While we've always faced relationship problems, I've been willing to forgive and believe in his promises of improvement.

However, these issues have started to take a toll on me. There have been moments when he's yelled at me and insulted me, claiming his success and intelligence due to earning more money. In reality, I hold a bachelor's degree and had a career as a software developer.

We jointly decided to move to the USA by 2023. He arrived before me, securing a job and handling initial logistics while I continued to work in my home country and applied for positions in the USA. In January, he convinced me to quit my job and join him.

Upon my arrival, the problems resurfaced. He continued to create conflicts, insult me, and belittle my contributions, despite my ongoing job search efforts. Fortunately, I was hired in February, but I faced a layoff in June, which added to my stress.

The job search has been incredibly stressful, and his discouragement and criticism have shattered my self-confidence. I find myself in a toxic environment, constantly feeling sad and regretful about leaving my country, family, and job for this venture with him. I'm at a loss, as I have nowhere to turn and limited resources to start over alone after losing everything.

Should I consider ending this marriage? What steps can I take to alleviate the immense stress I'm experiencing?

5430,Is This A Toxic Relationship?,"TW: Emotional/verbal abuse

So I been with my boyfriend since sometime in December. He acts like he's perfect and knows everything, even though he denies it and says he's smart. 

Anyway, he been trying to teach me things I should already know my age like cooking, cleaning.. like stuff a woman should do. He knows I tend to be messy like struggle to clean my room and stuff (suffer from ADHD, PTSD, and schizoaffective disorder). He tends to get so ""mad"" (he says he's just frustrated, not mad) at me if I make a mistake. I also have short term memory loss and learning disability. 
He gets loud if I make a mistake like if I forget an item from shopping list, or forget to be neat with organizing items on shelf. Those are just examples. 

I get some anxiety and even fear if I mess up he will yell at me again, so I often forget or make more mistakes.

On top of that, (I'm a Christian and he's a Christian too) I been having sex before marriage (sin) a lot to a point where I feel like I'm dying in my own body, and often feel like I'm on my way to hell and condemned. I feel deadly afraid of what happens when I die. I can't find rest in the Lord lately. 

Also he makes me cry when I get stressed and doesn't ask if I'm okay. Instead he says I need to stop crying that crying doesn't get you anywhere. He has good qualities about him like he smiles and laughs a lot, he pays rent and afford groceries, and he helps me to understand stuff. 

He also says he's a blessing and that if I leave him that I'll be losing my blessing. He also calls my actions stupid (not me stupid). However I believe actions make up for the person, so I believe he's really calling me stupid regardless of what he says. 

I tried breaking up with him before like three or four days ago, but I guess he didn't got the message. So I am at loss of what to do. Also my family tends to be toxic too.

5434,Am I in an abusive marriage?,"\*\*TL;DR;\*\* I can't tell whether or not I am actually being emotionally abused and am looking to get out of this marriage.

I wish people talked about the more subtle forms of abuse because it is so complex. I (F 24) have been married to my husband (M 27) for 2 years now. We've had consecutive therapy sessions for almost a year with very little change. We have the same problems we had 2 years ago because things always go unresolved. And when I try to resolve so we can move on, he gets upset and says that I am just bringing things up from the past because there's nothing going on that week. I have bpd so it's very hard to understand is this my reality or is he manipulating it? I think like am I splitting again, am I projecting? Am I making up these issues?

My needs are constantly not being met. He'll say something that hurts my feelings and when I bring it up and set a boundary he becomes super defensive and turns it into an argument. Then he accuses me of poor communication and says I never tell him whats going on when quiet frankly, I'm nervous about bringing anything up. He never compliments me because ""it's hard to give compliments"" but he's so quick to bring up my weight. So many times I was in front of him just bawling my eyes out and he would completely stone face and never comfort me. On the regular he's very bubbly and easy going but the moment I bring up anything I don't like, it's like he becomes an entirely different person that I can't even recognize. It's very scary to see that change. I've learned that he is not a safe space for my emotions.

It's very hard to leave. Every time I have made my mind up about leaving he just kind of reels me back in and I become more unsure of myself. I 100% feel like I am being manipulated but at the same time I feel like am I the problem? How do I get out? I need help. A part of me gets choked up about leaving but the other part knows it's the right decision. I have been trying to get out for 2 years and I fear that I will stay here for a few more years before I gather the strength to leave.

5436,Do we really need to break up?,"I (25F) was with my boyfriend (25M) for a little over 2 years, lived together for 1. For the last 6 months I've had intimacy issues because of an abusive relationship I had prior to meeting him - it wasn't clear what triggered it, but I'm having therapy for PTSD. He's been very understanding and this hasn't impacted the relationship too much - still very physically intimate, just no sex/similar

For the last few months I've been driving myself crazy feeling like something is off between us. We've both been very busy but something had just started feeling 'wrong'. I felt extremely guilty about things that I probably shouldn't have, and didn't understand how I felt 

I've since realised that my issue has been the pressure of marriage/kids. He's very set on both of these things, not necessarily on a timeline (though he's said he wants kids by 30), but just that he needs to know it will happen eventually. I can't guarantee that. I'm not certain I want kids - I probably will eventually but I can't guarantee it and he isn't willing to risk finding out another two years down the line. He suggested a deadline for me to make my decision - but I don't feel able to lock in this kind of decision at this point in my life. 

I think I can only be in the relationship if that pressure isn't there anymore, because its made me feel so terrible/guilty. I've realised recently that my intimacy problems actually started around the time he was planning to propose - but I asked him to push it back. There are maybe links here with the abusive relationship around losing a sense of self/ownership, I haven't really figured it out. 

I want to try to convince him that we don't need to decide on these strict timelines now - how can we be sure what we'll want in 5 years? But maybe it's not fair of me to do that. I really love him. I really want to make it work. Maybe I'm just in denial but I want to try to have another conversation with him about this - I probably will want kids eventually, it's just hard to be sure where life is going.

Can we fix this? Do we really need to break up?

Basically I’ve been having some doubts about my relationship. We’ve come across some differences in our beliefs/wants. For example, he wants to raise kids religious (specially Mormon) as I would prefer not to raise kids religious. He is very conservative and is in to politics (doesn’t believe in abortions, prefers traditional marriage/gender roles) and I would say I lean more liberal, but am not really into politics. He also is ready to take that “next step”. He wants us to fully commit to each other and be “one.” I do not feel like I’m ready for that. We’ve been together for about two years and have lived together for about one year. I’ve been considering moving out on my own, but staying together in the relationship. I really miss living alone and feel a little pressure to be more committed than I am willing to be, living together. We have a good relationship otherwise and I’m not ruling out us being together in the future, but I’m not ready to fully commit. And he wants me to fully commit. I have some past relationship trauma, not sure if these feelings are stemming from that? I’m definitely and introvert and greatly value my alone time. We have separate bedrooms right now and that’s really helpful, but I think I want more space? I don’t want to put a damper on our relationship by moving backwards, but I’m just not where he is yet.

5440,I (21F)found out that my mum (47f) had an affair and my paternity was contested,"I really don't know what to think, I'm pretty lost to be honest. Let me start at the beginning...

I grew up with a single mum, I was always told stories about how my father didn't come to visit me in hospital when I was born and that my mum drove herself home. He left soon after that, I have seen him once in my life when I was 12, for an hour or so, never again. 
I believed he didn't care about me. Our life was not easy at all and he never helped once, we struggled for the most part and he was a wealthy executive. I remember going to his office with my mum once and he refused to see us.

Recently, my mum remarried an old friend from back in the day and it turns out, he's the guy she had an affair with. I didn't put two and two together until they recently started reminiscing about old times and how they used to go out on these romantic getaway trips (they were both married with kids at the time) and work was always the excuse. After a while, they didn't hide their affair.

He's an okay guy but it kinda hurts that they're responsible for how things turned out. I've always heard whispers that my mum was responsible for my dad leaving but now I know why. I was born and he didn't believe I was his so he left. There wasn't even a formal divorce, he just disappeared for long enough that the court dissolved the marriage. 
The affair ended and he(my current step father) more or less went on with his life, he didn't leave his wife until recently when his last born went off to uni. Now he's here. 

Td;lr I don't excuse my birth father's behaviour but I can't help but resent my mum, I've tried to look at things differently but I can't. I want to talk to my boyfriend about it but I feel guilty even talking about it. I would appreciate any advice.

5449,I 25F wish my fiancé 27M loved me,"I have been with my fiancé for almost four years now and engaged for a little over six months. 
Wedding planning has been a breeze for the most part, life is good - we live together, virtually rent free, are pretty comfortable income wise. 

The thing is… 
I just wish he loved me. Like, was in love or had feelings for me. 

I’m no Beyoncé, but I can tell you that I’m confident that I’m conventionally/traditionally attractive. I have a good job. I am intelligent. I’m personable. I am the type of girl who brings him coffee in bed every morning and makes an effort to host his friends and does great at work cocktail
He is handsome, intelligent and neurodivergent. We also have a history of nonmonogamy. 

I know that in every relationship there is someone who loves more and I am honestly okay with being the one who does. 

When we first started seeing each other, he was very intent on it being casual - then when we started spending more time together, he did a “opportunity analysis” and figured it was best to enter into an exclusive relationship with me before someone else did and then he wouldn’t be able to see me at all. 
It kinda feels like that’s been a large part of our relationship - he’s taking me off the market so someone else doesn’t or because he doesn’t think it gets better for him than me. Not because he loves me or wants to be with me or sees my value independent from the market. 

Lately, I’m just at a slight wall and feeling defeated. 
He recently decided to see how long he could go without having sex with me.
Yesterday, he said he felt like he was settling by getting married. 
At this point, wedding planning is progressing. 

My biggest problem at this point is that I love him more than words can say and can’t imagine my life without him. He’s been there through some of the wildest times of my life and I appreciate his companionship. 

Am I dumb for entering into a marriage with someone who tolerates me?

5450,I (38f) found recent/new pictures on my husbands (41m) phone of the person he cheated with,"My husband had a longterm affair with a close friend of his, the affair lasted about two years but the emotional connection may have been present for longer. I don't think he was even consciously aware of that part. He and I have been together for 20 years and we have two beautiful children (5 and 7). He initially had wanted to leave our marriage but I persuaded him to at least try some form of counselling and when we began counselling, it was clear to us both that staying together was the best thing for our children. My husband and I get along really well, we never argue and even if the intimacy isn't 100%, it is manageable. I guess we both are resigned to being together for our children.

He told me about the affair 6 months ago and for about a month he was convinced he was leaving. Going as far as telling all of our friends and family that he will be leaving the marriage. He said it was because he was in love with someone else and wanted to pursue this relationship. Anyway, he ended up staying and cutting contact with his AP. He has been NC ever since then. 

Over the weekend, we were out as a family and he had taken some pictures on his phone and I wanted to upload them to the cloud to have access. I opened up the photos app and noticed pictures of his AP. They were all screenshots of her, ones that he had taken from her socials. There must have been at least 30-40, all of her. Some even screen recordings. The timestamps show that he's visiting her profile quite frequently throughout the day. The screenshots only go back two weeks and nothing before then. He is still NC with her, there is no communication between them, I know this for certain (i won't go into it here but I know for sure there is no communication)

Does this still count as cheating? I know i will probably receive quite a bit of negativity for this but if all he's doing is pining after her on socials, I can handle that. What I am worried about is, if it goes further.

Hi, this is my first time posting here and I hope that I’m doing everything right <3

Me and my fiancé have been friends for two years and have been seriously dating for one year and will be getting married in May! He is the kindest person I know and makes me feel loved and we have great communication, I feel like I can tell him anything! There is just one thing that I’m too nervous to share with him.

Recently I have been feeling self-conscious and I don’t know why. He loves me and tells me that I am beautiful and that I’m the only one for him but I get terrible nightmares and anxiety about not being enough. We both chose to be abstinent until marriage so I’m sure most of it is that I’m worried that he will be disappointed when we are intimate after we get married. I have had relationships in the past where my partner has cheated so I am also scared to have my heart broken if he regrets marrying me. He has done nothing to warrant this reaction from me and I feel that my insecurities are rooted in some self-image troubles I had as a teen … have any of you felt this way and what did you do to improve your self-esteem?

5457,my (f23) porn addicted husband (m26) said he finds my body boring.," My (f23) porn addicted husband (m26) said he finds my body boring.

My husband has struggled with a p0rn addiction his whole life, during the course of our 8 month marriage during the beginning we both agreed to a no p0rn rule. 

It went over both of our boundaries supposedly. Well multiple times during these months I’ve caught him watching it, just sneakier and sneakier. I’m a woman with very low confidence and it makes me uncomfortable knowing my s/o uses others to get off. Each time I’ve been understanding & non-judgmental but have expressed that it upsets me and have cried begging him to change and stop, he always says he will. 

Yesterday I caught him again (look at their instagram clicked link history ladies) & found porn & OF models. This time I was angry at first, because the last time I caught him was only a month ago and I poured my heart out to him. But afterwards I comforted him, and I asked him why doesn’t he just use the countless nudes and videos I’ve sent him instead, he replied with “it’s like my brain finds it boring, it’s old, it’s the same” and I think that completely and utterly broke me, hearing my husband refer to my naked body as “boring”. I’m someone who has suffered deep depression due to body dysmorphia and low self esteem, so hearing that come from the man I’ve been so vulnerable with was irreversible damage. I can’t look at him and I don’t want him to touch me or look at me, I start hyperventilating when I think about it. I don’t think I’m strong enough mentally to go through this.


Questions: How can I get through this? How can I help myself while also helping him? He wants to change how can I help him?

5464,Lied to for 10 years,"TL;DR Recently found out my husband had an online affair 10 years ago with a mutual friend the first year we started dating exclusively. How do I react? 

My husband (27M) and I (27F) have been married for 5 years. Together for 10 years.
We had a bit of a rough start to marriage. He suffered from some severe mental health issues that I believed stemmed from a tough childhood etc. I was very supportive during this time but he very closed off and didn’t confide in me much. One of our mutual friends I’ll call Kate (29F) also was suffering mentally and they confided in each other over a matter of months. After I while I became a little frustrated as he was telling her things but not telling me etc. Long story short, he got the help he needed, he’s during really well. Our marriage suffered a little bit but we worked through it and he expressed how much he wanted us to work. We don’t see Kate much anymore, she hasn’t been in our lives for a good year or so.
Recently it came out that Kate had an affair while she and her husband were separated like 7 years ago. But they since got back together. My husband knew about this secret after they confided in each other a few years back. I asked my husband, why didn’t you say anything? Why didn’t you tell me? Does she know something about you? And he proceeded to tell me that he had an online affair with an another mutual friend I'll call Issy (26F) in the first year we started dating and he told Kate about it. 
I’m very confused. I’ve known Issy a long time, we were friends while this was supposed affair was happening. This situation is just a mess of secrets spilling out. Two marriages now at risk.

5465,I (24f) can't do with being caught in between my parents (56f and 59m) divorce anymore. Is it possible for me to ease the tension?,"

Gonna keep this short and simple if possible. My parents have been separated for about 3 years. I currently live with my mother(56f). There are many reasons for the divorce. My father(59m) can be a very mean man to say the least. He can be very emotionally unavailable and he's a very prideful individual. He's also a strong atheist while my mother is a devout Christian. My mother told me that she had checked out of their marriage when I was 12 years old but she stayed with him because my grandmother. My father's mother developed Alzheimer's. There was a 8 year period from between when my grandmother symptoms first appeared to when she finally passed away. After she passed away, my mom filed for their divorce. And I can't help but feel that during that time my father had a chance to make things right, but didn't. In the final year of her living in the house, there was constant arguments in disputes. My father vented to me a lot about how upset and angry he was my mother. So much you'd think he would hate her. In fact, he told me that once.

Now in recent months he's begun reaching out to her apologizing, saying that he wished he had worked harder to make the marriage work. And since I live with her. I keep being caught in the middle of this situation. It's stressing me out and I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm honestly thinking of moving out because I just don't want to be around for this anymore.

5467,It still bothers me that he (38 M) wouldn't have married me if I (36 F) didn't break up,"I would like some opinions on this manner. My husband (38 M) and I (36 F) have been married for 7 years and have two children, a 4 year-old daughter and a 2 year-old son. Meanwhile, I really have no complaints over my marriage, this thing still lingers in my mind from time to time. I want to forget it but can't. I never got the romantic proposal I've always dreamt about since childhood. Sometimes I can't help it but think I've forced it on him, that I made him feel he had no choice.Prior to getting married, we were living together for nearly 8 years. I was 20 when I met him and he was 22. I was getting tired of waiting too long, his failed promises and excuses to continue extending the timeframe. I walked away one day and the next month, he came knocking on my door apologizing for everything, promising he would be the man I always wanted and proposed. I was still depressed that it took a break-up to get it but I still said yes. I was both happy but hurt at the same time. I think we should've gone for counseling but we never did. I forgave him too fast and we sped up with the wedding.
  

  
TLDR:

My huband (38 M) has changed for the better over the years and really did kept to his words. But that small feeling that it took a break-up for him to marry me (36 F), that it wasn't a romantic proposal (the one where the man surprises her) and he likely wouldn't have proposed if I didn't break up still bothers me till this day.

Self sabotage lead to break up

For context I F(23) and my former boyfriend M(24) just broke up. I have low self worth and recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (These issues stemming from childhood trauma) I would have fits of paranoia that my partner was cheating on me with his coworker or thought he was dating me to get over his ex girlfriend. I feel bad, this episodes don’t define my character. Long story short I couldn’t trust in my relationship. I would seek evidence that my partner was cheating on me my snooping through his belongings. I would have mood swings if my partner was less affectionate one day than the other. I feel terrible, I already am on a journey of self healing I’ve been in (CBT)therapy for two years and constantly seek psychiatric help treat my bipolar disorder, self work I was working on prior to meeting him. I just want to be healthy ,have the positive experience with all interpersonal relationships and have love I never received as a child. I hurt him in this relationship, hurt my self with my negative delusions. Truth be told I love him, for me he was the first person to show me kind love and respect. It devastates me I lost someone who cared. I want to self improve bpd, I’m currently seeking the resources that allows me to heal that trauma. All I want is to get better so I can give the people in my life the love they deserve and also protect myself from these negative thought patterns and habits. I’m devastated I self sabotage a love that was truly kind. I feel like a monster. I miss him, I want him back. I know it’s unlikely that ex’s reconnect. I want him back. Is the damage irreparable? Can people with borderline have healthy relationships? Is there anyway I can win him back? What are healthy coping mechanisms?

5471,Feeling guilty for breaking up with my (F22) boyfriend (M24) of 5 years,"To start of I don't know if I can say I was in an abusive relationship. He is genuinely the kindest person I have ever known. The only part of the relationship where he did hurt me was our sexual relationship.

In the beginning everything was fine but then slowly things started to change. Normally he would listen to my 'no' but now he would ask again. Eventually he would push untill I would stop saying 'no'. He would ask to do certain sexual acts and some things I am just not into. But then during sex he would do it anyway and use the excuse he couldn't help himself. 

We have had many conversations and he always said he would do better and that he feels sorry. He would be better for a week but then everything would go back to normal.

Sometimes when I didn't want to have sex he would ignore for an hour or just be annoyed for the rest of the day.

One day he actually pinned me down while I was saying 'stop' and 'no'. I tried to fight him off but I couldn't. Afterwards he apologized a 100 times. But I can't look at him in the same way anymore.

I don't feel attracted to him anymore and he says that my sex drive has always been low and that there is something wrong with me. He says other men would have left me with this little sex but he stays because he loves me. 

After that incident he did change and nothing like that every happend again. But I still broke up with him.

I just can't get over this guilty feeling. He finally changed because I told him I would leave him if he didn't and I still left him.

I was able to connect my phone to wifi and send a message to someone to see if they could take me home. Once I got home it was as if nothing had happened. He started asking questions about “how does this hat look on me?” Like he didn’t just leave me stranded all by myself with no way of calling. He’s also mentally abusive. He repeatedly tells me I’m no good. I’m not enough. I’m not pretty. I’m fat. He could easily find someone better. He tells me I need him. All these things that I started to believe. He flirted with multiple women while I was pregnant and even after I had our child. To this day he still tries to cheat and gives multiple women attention and I just can’t do it anymore.

5481,Learning to trust again?,"Hey all,
I (f23) was in a 6 year relationship (M23) and the last four years he was emotionally and sometimes physically abusive.
He was the first person in my life I have ever loved and wanted to spend my life with.

I ended it in Feb this year due to the constant gaslighting and fear, I have two children (who currently in care due to unrelated reasons and luckily didn't witness anything ever).

After he left, I felt great, started therapy for myself to help with the damage done plus other mental health issues I have, am trying to move to a new area for a new start ect.

We get on okay now for the sake of the kids, and seriously deep down it soothes me somehow as I feel like I've got closure from the whole relationship.

My main concern at the moment is June this year, I started dating someone (M24) who I have known a very long time.
I'm aware he will never hurt me, but the second there is tension I'm anxious and react badly.

I'm not as understanding as I use to be thanks the the past, I somehow feel like these are excuses because I do care for him but can't seem to when he needs me the most and it's making me feel like a terrible person :/

I'm also scared of being committed again for years for it all to fall into pieces or be ruined somehow :(

It's like every time he's mad (over anything, we both have stressful lives) I instantly try to not care or overcare in fear.

How do I learn to trust that I am indeed now in a healthy and safe relationship?
How do I build and recognise how to actually be with someone?
I feel like I have no clue, I even grew up watching domestic violence so if I'm honest I have no idea what love is.

Literally any advice I will take and I'm willing to explain more if needed.

5482,if i consent to it is it abuse?,"TW physical violence, sex. 

I’m sorry to ask but I’ve been really unsure lately as to whether or not this relationship dynamic is safe or healthy. 

When I (F21) met my boyfriend (M24), we both expressed that we would be open to experimentation in the bedroom. I have only had 2 previous partners while he’s had quite a few, so I don’t really know what I’m into. 

This is relevant because I gave him permission to slap/spank me etc. (which he said he likes doing) but I thought that it was kind of a bedroom thing I guess? 

About a month in he just started hitting me out of nowhere. Or punching my legs or arms, but never really hard enough to leave a mark although when it caught me off guard I would sometimes fall over. I don’t know, I laughed because this clearly wasn’t out of anger or anything; we weren’t fighting, he was just playing. 

Then he started pinching me so hard I’d scream and slapping me lightly in front of his friends and they would all laugh and say “Stop!” but it seemed more like a joke. I don’t know how to explain this but it was kind of a joke that he was abusing me I guess? Because he wasn’t really. 

And then recently we were sort of jokingly playfighting then he hit me in the shoulder. Like, closed fist, full bodied force, and I immediately curled up, but still laughed because this was our joke, you know? He hit me again and I asked him to stop and then again a few more times. It was strange because I didn’t feel scared, but I started crying. Not because it hurt I think it was just shock and he looked so scared and he started crying too and held me for hours. He said he thought we were playing around and he didn’t mean to. 

To be fair, I do sometimes hit back, which is where I feel like I’m still consenting to it. You know, he’ll smack me and I’ll immediately smack back, lighter though. And I’ll laugh, which I guess is misleading. I don’t like it but I guess I don’t really mind it? 

I had to walk around for weeks with that bruise on my shoulder, and promised my 3 different people he wasn’t abusing me because I kind of don’t think he is. I think he’d stop if I asked. 

I’m sorry, I hope I’m not wasting anyone’s time. I know I’m rambling so I’m sorry if it’s kind of unreadable.

I often began to wonder if it was really the right thing. Yes, he was toxic and bad for me, but I’d missed him for so long - maybe it WAS meant to be? Wrong! It’s taken me a year and a half to get over and the last year we spent together was more off than on. I had a long time to get better and I just wasn’t healing. I spent nearly two and a half years grieving and recovering from our relationship and it was so bloody hard. I had to watch him move on during this process. I started to think I would never get over it, but I have! And the people I attract now are so much kinder, so much more accomplished, and can return the love I gave. I didn’t attract anyone like this until I began to heal and met some pretty toxic people after him that made me think I should’ve just stayed. I’m SO glad I didn’t and you will be too.

I wanted to leave this here for somebody in the position I was in last year. It DOES get better. I promise. Even if it takes you years, it’s beyond worth it!

Today was brutal. His abusive texts towards me were relentless.

But right now I'm eating Chinese takeout alone in a hotel room, where he can't find me, and I'm feeling downright giddy. I'm free!!! I can't begin to tell you how happy that thought makes me. I survived him. I got out. I'm free!

I thought I was going to die in that hell.

And everything is still a mess. I'm essentially homeless. He is tracking my emails and whatsapp and who knows what else. He won't let me communicate with our kids without him being there. We have separate bank accounts and he has always made me pay all the bills and mortgage out of my account and not given me access to his money, so I currently have no money to live on since I'm paying for all the loving expenses of the house he lives in and he keeps all his money to himself. But I am fucking free of him.

And he gave me the best gift this time. He usually knows just how far to take things before he apologizes and reels me back in with promises to be better. But he went way, way, way past the line of no return this time. Honestly, that is the nicest thing he ever gave me. He gave me his authentic self for a full 72 hours non stop. So, I can't make any excuses for him. I see him for what he is.

For anyone who extends the benefit of the doubt to their abuser - who believes that their abuser is just a trauma survivor who doesn't mean it, that they won't go as far as others do, that they are a good person who has difficulty regulating their emotions- I never believed my husband was capable of 1/4 of the things he has done and said in the past 72 hours. If you told me one week ago that he would behave like this I never would have believed you. But I now completely believe that he is capable of killing me.

I (29F) think I might be being emotionally abused by my husband (39M) but I’m struggling so much to accept that. I won’t go super indepth but gist of the matter is 

- he’s an alcoholic and often blames this on me, saying it’s the only way he can cope with me.
-in high stress situations he will shout at me, and then become personal with his attacks. Has no issue  doing this in public either
-moves the goal posts during the more personal arguments. Says i work too much (i’m self employed) or that I don’t do enough around the house (i’m disabled and he’s unemployed) or something about my family (i’m very close with them) any argument we have, these three things are guaranteed to be brought up.

I could go on, and thinking about it makes me realise it is abuse but then there’s times he’s lovely and caring. He’a finally started on renovation work (despite us livig in the new place for almost a place) but he still shouted at me because I didn’t want to go pick out paint colours when I needed to work. 

After finally opening up to my mum and a friend, I decided that I need to leave. But right now I’m struggling with that.

I stayed because then I got the guilt trip of please don’t leave you’re all I have. On and off for the next 2 months it was him being kind and “normal” then it would be him trying to kick me out again. One day I had enough and left. The last four months I have been buying a house, reestablishing my life. He keeps begging and arguing for another chance- just got diagnosed with a mood disorder, so because he’s back in therapy and on meds he says it will never happen again. 

I don’t think mental illness is an excuse to hurt someone physically and emotionally. But, am I wrong? Should I be sympathetic of this and ultimately give him the benefit of the doubt? I did find out he was talking to woman I didn’t know on social media for “attention” for months of our relationship because he says I didn’t give him attention he liked. I struggle with the thought of finding someone to love ever again- because truly I thought he was my future until all this started happening.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
5510,My lawyer said “He has the right to be angry in his own home” after he pushed me into the cabinets and his car,"I didn’t get hurt, for context.  I have no bruises from the incident.  I called my lawyer and she said she wouldn’t pursue an order of protection and called his behavior passive-aggressive. He pushed me at least twice that I remember.  He left briefly after that and I called my lawyer.  The title of this post contains her direct quote after I told her what happened.

Prior to pushing me, he had been throwing things around the kitchen, slamming objects down all around me and right next to me, scaring me while I was trying to make dinner for the kids. He pushed me out of the way and I fell into the cabinet.  Later he told me to move my car so he could leave, which I did, and he pushed me into his passenger car door when he ran out of the house as he shoved past me while I was on my way back inside and him on his way out.

I don’t know what I want from this post.  I feel abandoned in this situation. I don’t qualify for emergency shelter because of my income level, but I have no money because of this divorce process and paying for all the bills.  I don’t even have enough to pay for a therapist anymore.  I don’t live near my family at all, they’re all out of state.  I have no friends to stay with here because we moved closer to his family just before the pandemic.

5512,Finally building up the courage to leave. Go back and forth on whether I’m making the right decision though even though I know what’s right for me. Could use some encouragement.,My bf (26M) has been pretty emotionally abusive the entire time we’ve been together and I (26F) have finally built up the courage to leave. I have been unsatisfied with my life the entire time I’ve lived with him in another state. I put my dreams on hold to move away with him and I have been unhappy since I came here. My mental health is plummeting because of all sorts of things but mostly because of him. He degrades me constantly and has major narcissistic tendencies. I’m in a state of fight or flight regularly and walk on eggshells everyday. I’ve been though so much with him and I know the right thing is for me to get out but why is it so hard? Everyday I rethink my decision and get so sad to think about me leaving. I’m only remembering the random good things we’ve been through and am afraid I’m going to change my mind.

5515,I just had my first PTSD flashback and I need some support right now please!,"I left my abusive relationship eight months ago.  The situation I was in was straight out of a horror movie.  I immediately moved in with my mom, because I am battling a severe autoimmune disease and need help taking care of my children, I knew that I was going to have some major trauma and PTSD issues because of the horrific things I went through however, I’ve had to completely blocked out out of my mind and focus on my daughter. I have a 9 your old daughter with autism who has needed all sorts of help and support from me, and that has been my main focus. I finally made a breakthrough with her last night, and I felt such a weight lifted, but then immediately knew that I was now going to start having to face what I went through.

It has all hit me like a ton of bricks and I just had my first PTSD flashback. I just arrived to a little fair at a nearby park with my mom and kids and it happened while I was trying to get out of the car. I let my mom know what was going on and found a bench to sit down and write this because I don’t know what else to do right now. We are in the process of finding me a good trauma therapist , but I need support like right now.  I became completely paralyzed and I seen played through my head like a movie of one of the most traumatic things I went through, and I don’t even know how to feel right now. I am an extremely logical person and have been trying to prepare myself to work through this, but was not expecting that.

I have not been able to talk to any of my friends about this because it is too painful so this is actually the best outlet for me at the moment.  If anyone can message me or help talk me through this, it would be much appreciated. Especially if anyone has gone through extremely traumatic things. I have no problem elaborating in private messages.

5517,What if he's right and I'm really the abusive one?,"He says I make him feel ashamed and that's not okay. He says I expect him to be perfect and that's not fair. Whenever I'm around him now I'm angry. I've started being meaner to him than I would usually be to anyone. Idk what it is but just the way he acts sets something off inside of me that wants to lash out. He disgusts me. He makes me want to fight.

But what has he really done? I don't even know. He's 100% sure that all he's ever done is try his best to support me, that he's never done a thing wrong in our relationship. I have a picture in my phone of my arm with an IV drip in it in the ER, holding a pamphlet they gave me for the local DV shelter. He didn't hurt me, I was just under a lot of stress and he was being a jerk about money so I hadn't eaten enough and I passed out in public. I keep that picture to remind me that *something's wrong here,* but I honest to god can't even tell you what it is anymore.

I don't know. We were arguing a bit ago and I stormed out like an idiot. I'm barefoot, in my PJs, laying underneath a park slide and getting eaten alive by mosquitoes. It feels better than being at ""home"" with him. I'm starting to get cold, but I think I might just sleep here. I don't know why though. I'm the one who picked the fight.

In July of 2020 my husband was arrested for domestic violence and I had a PFA against him.  I was done, but I got sucked back in and by November we were living together again.  Things were going much better than before. No more screaming matches, no more hitting or physical violence at all.  He stopped talking to all of the other women he was talking to and finally got a job. But....I couldn't get over that past hurt.  I fell out of love and I am not happy.  Too much has happened and I should never have gotten back with him.  We have 3 kids together too.  I was hoping to announce a separation after the holidays so that my husband wouldn't ruin Christmas for the kids.  But he figured it out a couple days ago.  He says that I am going through a manic phase (never been diagnosed as bipolar btw) and that I am going to regret my decision once I am on my own.  He tells me I am hurting the kids and I broke my promises to him and to the kids.  I'm starting to overthink.  I know I need to leave, but is that being selfish?  I don't want to hurt the kiddos.

5521,Is it abuse if they tear you down and tell you they love you right after?,"Any time I bring up an issue to my boyfriend, he immediately shuts me down. Today, he said he doesn't care if I leave and then said he doesn't even care about my safety anymore. Usually he doesn't let me leave at night because I'm disabled. I have muscular dystrophy. 

He said he tired of the drama and said ""I don't care if you want to leave, I don't even care about your safety anymore"". Then he said he does but is tired of dealing with me and wants me to leave. As I was walking away he said ""don't think I don't love you"". Um, okkkkaayyy. What he did seems to be the opposite of love. 

This was because I've been bringing up issues I'm having with his family. He thinks I should stand up to them and it's not his job to deal with them on my behalf.  I'm tired of nothing getting resolved because he shuts me down. I'm tired of being treated like this and him making me out to be the problem.

5524,Leaving an abusive relationship- am i handling it the right way?,"My boyfriend who I've been with for 2.5 years can be very abusive/manipulative, especially when he drinks.. I have never seen anything like it. We got into one of many huge fights last night and i have had enough, so i deleted him on social media and blocked him. I do not want to reach out to him and explain that i need to move on because i have tried before and he somehow always talks his way back into the relationship. I am resentful towards him now and lack intimacy with him because of all the times he put me through hell, so its become an empty relationship for me.. I love him, but i love my happiness more and know I deserve better. His behavior is not acceptable to me.

when he drinks he will not let me sleep if he wants to argue. When i eventually get frustrated and tell him to leave me alone, he gets aggressive and will not let it go.. He has kept me up all night long at times.. Last night he took my cell phone and lied that he had it, when i asked if i could check his pockets and went to reach he would swing at me.. He has hid my car keys before and got very mad and aggressive when i found them and went to take them.. When i caught him with my phone last night he smashed it on the ground, breaking it. He will put his hands on me and while doing so he will say things out loud like ""stop hitting me, why are you hitting me!""- meanwhile i am not touching him other than to hold him back or get my personal belongings he won't give to me. He will make up scenarios of how the argument started that are far from the truth. After all is said and done he will try to guilt-trip me in some way.. He isn't this bad at all when he isn't drunk but still cannot take any criticism but has no problem giving it out, also seems like he wants to debate everything... Why is he like this?!

I have blocked him from social media and just want to start the healing process without a conversation. I fear he will somehow manipulate me to be back in the relationship...

I'm so angry that he clearly wasn't as invested in the relationship as I was. For months I got well if you're not happy then leave & then one day I decided to do just that. 

I'm angry that he has had a number of decent women in his life who like me, have tried their best with him but no one can change a narc abuser. We have all made suggestions & tried to be the best person for him but nothing is ever good enough. 

It is always his way is the only way & you live life in a haphazard, chaotic manner, never knowing where you are. I keep wanting to say are you happy that you have effed up yet another relationship???

I said no that she only did it after I made sure she was ok. (She only did it twice and is fine now) He started getting upset saying I need to be more careful calling me stupid and retarded (that's a trigger word for me and I've expressed this to him).

He has called me disgusting and shitty for asking about the girls he met on vacation and exchanged phone numbers with.  That’s only one example of when he’s called me those words. I told him I no longer could handle the way he talked to me and his response was “if you act a certain way I’m going to talk to you a certain way.”  We ended things because he stayed out all night this past weekend and I asked him who he was with. That was the question that pushed him over the edge. He said that I have serious issues and can’t be with me anymore.

He bothers me about something about dinner I don't remember anymore, I give him a clean cold answer and go make us dinner cause he ""couldn't do it"" for some reason.

2min later he goes back to the kitchen and says:
""look, this isn't working. I can't take this anymore""

And for mine and his surprise I just said:
""oh YOU can't take it anymore? Okay then don't.""

And kept making dinner.

A whole conversation almost without abusive behaviour took place. I even asked him how he thought I felt after our last argument (2 weeks ago I broke up with him but suddenly we were ok again like always) and he didn't even remember what I was talking about. So I told him that's one of the reasons I can't feel any pain now. For me it was one more traumatic situation and for him it was Thursday. He talked about leaving, about our paths not being the same anymore, he never had a relationship before so he asked how's it supposed to work to end it up. Everything was so much easier than ever for me this time. 

We talked about how to break up, etc.. Suddenly he says: ""let's go have dinner?""

We went, and it started being normal again! I don't know if he's actually preparing to leave me or if it's just another.. I don't know I'm so confused!! He's in therapy and he said he was trying to go there sooner than the appointment he's made.

She was supposed to stay longer but her boyfriend didn’t leave, just drove around my grandmas neighborhood and guilted her into going home with him instead of staying with family.

He has show several signs of abusive behavior before. I know he’s abusive but she doesn’t see it anymore.

The agent said he's seen a lot of these cases and it is always better to have them move away so they aren't tempted to go looking for their previous victim. I'm not convinced an extra 35 miles is going to stop a determined, jealous, irrational person, but I do enjoy taking his home away from him because he almost took existence from me.

So I sent in a completed form. I feel like I'm kind of stoking the fire here forcing him to move away, but I just hate him so much, I would hate to run into him. I occasionally get nightmares where he breaks into my house again, seeing his evil face turn the corner smiling knowing he's got in. He already broke into my house in real life when he was originally on bail before the sentencing. He held me hostage until I was able to convince him that I would be his Valentine's date like he wanted (it was December wtf man) and I got him to leave on his own. He won't fall for that twice. I posted the full story here recently if you want a better idea of the kind of person I'm talking about here.

I feel like I can expect retaliation but I already was since he probably irrationally thinks I'm the reason he got sent to prison. Know that this is not someone who has changed his ways. He has a prison dating profile that says he ""doesn't bite... much"" alluding to the attempted murder charges. He was charged with 23 felonies from what he did to me.

I then asked kindly if he minded that I stay a few more days in Europe. Because I’m on maternity leave and I’ve been planning this trip for a long time.

5562,Is it right that i feel unsafe?,"Me and my boyfriend are on LDR for 2 years already and have been communicating on fb daily. We got into a huge fight yesterday over a very minor detail. Our last fight was 4 months ago. But now he became very different. He deleted our whole fb conversation, block/unblock me, and sent me obscure messages that he will get back on me (he never threatened me before in any way).

I just seen his msgs and did not reply but what really alarmed me was he sent me images of a dead and beaten up dog. I have never felt this unsafe ever in my life. I tried to confront him about it and after much interrogation he told me he searched for dead dog images in google, which he did ""to fill in that anger"". 

Good thing his browser account is linked to my phone, and to my disbelief i saw google searches of ""murder"", ""murder baby"", ""dead dog"" and very disturbing photos of severely dismembered bodies.

I tried to coax him what were his ways of threatening me and his answers were weird (massage, treat me food) and when we screenshared and asked him to let me see hhis web history, he deleted it. He also told me he only searched ""dead dogs"" and nothing else. Lastly, i asked him a hypothetical question what he would do if i was physically near him and he answered he "" just want to slap my face and hurt you enough to understand his anger""

I am so scared right now. All of my thoughts of having a future with him (living in USA to be with him and having a family) is all gone because he has shown a psychopathic side of him. I just wanted to share, i dont know whats going to happen next. He is literally the kindest person and i know would never hurt me in any way (except for yesterday's events)

He did assure me the rest of the case is being prosecuted to the full extent (he had other charges) so at least he should be unable to own a gun ever again as a felon. I feel absolutely gutted, what the heck was an order of protection good for if it does not protect me or punish him for violating it??? Do I have any basis to sue them for refusing to press charges when I did everything I was supposed to as far as reporting and asking charges to be pressed?

5573,Termination of Parental Rights,"I had a court date to extend my order of protection a couple weeks ago . The judge ended up granting it for five years and mentioned he didn’t see any paperwork for termination of parental rights from me. I took this as a hint and asked the advocates about it later. They said in their court system an individual is able to petition to terminate a parents rights. That blew my mind. I had done research on termination of parental rights but everything from the state said that the state had to be the petitioner in cases like that so I just assumed it was that way in other courts. 

So I ended up petitioning to terminate his rights today and included a statement from my ex’s other sons mother.

But now I am afraid. I don’t want him to get this paperwork and end up blowing a fuse and hurting me or my son. I’m staying with my parents and he knows where the house is. I don’t feel safe at all sleeping and being vulnerable in my own house because the last time he felt like I was ‘taking his son from him’ he threw me on the ground and strangled me til I lost consciousness. It’s crippling to even imagine that happening again. He terrifies me and I don’t know what to do or where to stay or how long to stay somewhere else when this thing gets rolling.

5577,Finding the right supportive spouse after abuse,"So, I was in an abusive relationship for 7 years. I finally left 3 and a half years ago. It took up the majority of my youth. We were never married and fortunately had no children that had to be subjected to the violence.

I suffer from PTSD and it has seriously affected my ability to find a partner that I can feel safe with and often that winds up becoming too much for potential partners. I have a lot of emotional responses and sometimes get overly defensive in reaction to anything that could be perceived as a put down or that gives me any indication that they don't care about me or my emotional well-being. I'm hyper-aware and feels like my brain always has its antenna on to hear things to prevent me from getting into a relationship where something small like that could turn into violence.

I didn't have a lot of support from my friends or really anyone except my parents when it came to leaving and I had to do a lot of self-soothing and work trying to take care of just myself with no support. As a result, I still have a lot of confidence and emotional safety issues on top of managing triggers and other PTSD symptoms.

Last year I was dating this not-yet-divorced man who was so incredibly wonderful and was perfect for me. He adored me and was very loving and affectionate. Then out of nowhere he broke up with me and it has been very difficult for me to trust even more now.

I've been seeing a man for the last 8 months or so who has BP2. He also was just out of a devastating end to a relationship and we've been taking things slow. I know that he also needs a lot of care and I've tried to be sensitive to it and not take what his needs are personally. But sometimes he says things that make me question whether or not he even likes me, such as I have poor posture or I overuse a particular word. These things make me very nervous that he's just keeping me around because he's lonely or will dump me. He's said many times about how he's not really over his ex, but I try not to take these things personally.

All of these things just put things in my head that make me feel like I'm not worthy of love or that I'll get myself stuck in another bad relationship just so I won't be alone, or even worse, go back to my abuser. I'm 34 and time keeps ticking and I don't know why it feels so impossible to find someone who will love and care for me the way I deserve.

5578,Do you ever wonder if your abuser is right about you?,"I sometimes wonder how many of our issues are just abuse and how many are actually my fault. 

He says I’m a compulsive liar, which I disagree with, but of course if I was one of those people with that disorder then I wouldn’t necessarily know it and saying I’m not lying is exactly what a liar would say who’s lying to themselves and is convinced their lies are true. 

He says I constantly misspeak and say offensive things when I’m trying really hard to be nice and appropriate. I’m an awkward person by nature so I know some of this is true, but I’m successful in a leadership position at work and my subordinates seem to respond well to me so do I just have this problem with him cause he makes me nervous or is this an issue I should be really concerned about? I worry that it’s going to affect my professional life if I’m really as bad as he says I am. Maybe people at work are just being nice to me because I’m pretty (I guess)  and I’m their boss (that’s his theory and it makes sense) 

He says I’m irresponsible with money but I disagree and don’t really feel like I’ve been given a real chance since I’ve been with him so long pretty much since I became an adult and he’a Always controlled the finances.

I guess those are the main things I worry about. In general he says I’m kind of an inept person and that I wouldn’t be able to survive without him. I’m trying to leave but I don’t want to be one of those people who dismisses every criticism because it’s something my abuser used to say. I want to be a successful and independent person but according to him I’m just not at the moment and I need someone to keep me on the right track.

Then I unlocked the other door for him and he came in and cornered me in the kitchen screaming in my face and then he punch the refrigerator door right above my head but also punched down on my head so hard that my spine was compressed. 

He came upstairs and told our daughter that we were getting divorced and she started crying then he said mockingly that he was gonna get to see her as much as he wanted. I was still so mad I said I would call the police and tell them what he did and he said if he saw blue lights he would come up stairs and beat me until they pulled him off of me.

5596,Victory day!,"Some background: I'd been with my abusive nex for 17 years, split up early this year when I kicked him out. I stopped him from video contact with our kids when they were showing signs of trauma from his abuse of them. 

Today was the first court hearing over custody. He was asking for 50/50. He got supervised contact, which is what I was asking for. 

He'd denied the abuse allegations but the judge made him admit he had an anger problem. Not only that, he shot himself in the foot by lying. The judge asked him to provide proof. He won't be able to. When they find out he might lose the supervised contact as well before it even starts.

I'm so happy they saw him for what he is. He'll fail at what they ask him to do, because that's what he does. He'll give up and be a victim. And I'll be free. 

&#x200B;

I also found out today that he's moved on to a new supply. I'm happy about that too. It means he knows he's lost and he can't do anything to me ever again. I feel sorry for the new woman but that's not my problem anymore.

5604,I (42f) desperately need some space. Just moved in with boyfriend (50m) and he is smothering me. What to do?,"Just as the title says. We moved in together in March and I have not had a moment to myself since.

He is self employed so he makes sure to leave for work when I do (sometimes a little after I’ve left) but always ALWAYS makes sure he’s home when I get home. When we are home, he is essentially following me around the house. I have even had to talk to him about the bathroom because he was just opening a closed bathroom door and strolling right in to talk to me. 

The job that I work is a classroom setting and I have people around me literally all day, as well as a teenage daughter to care for. I do not get one moment to myself, except a few minutes in my car here and there. Prior to this, it was just my daughter and I, so I am used to being able to breathe once in awhile, and have space. Now I have none at all. 
I have tried talking about this, but as a man that is 50 years old and stalks my location and social media etc on a regular basis, he didn’t take it very well. I don’t think he would ever hurt me but definitely has a temper. 

We have been dating off and on for 3 years.. moving in together was clearly a huge mistake but that’s a whole separate post, as I have no way of getting out currently.

I have a huge exam on Wednesday and I’ve been studying non-stop for it. A friend of mine lent me their notes because they already took the class, and I woke up from a nap Saturday night to find out that my boyfriend spilled sauce all over it and there were so many concepts that were not salvageable. 

I fully comprehend now that it was an accident, but when I initially saw it, I freaked out. I NEED to pass this final if I want to pass the class, and in my mind, the notes being ruined just erased all my chances of doing so. Added to the fact that these were not my notes, I went ballistic, and eventually, he started yelling back, and things just got really bad and physical. My boyfriend has not spoken to me since. He didn’t sleep at home these past 2 nights. 

I’ve tried apologizing to him, I’ve apologized to everyone in his family, but I still feel so horrible.

5622,Considering filing a formal Title IX complaint against my nex,"Some background for those of you who don’t know - Title IX is a law that protects against gender discrimination in schools. It ensures equality between sports spending and is an avenue for people who have experienced other gender-based discrimination including abuse, SA, stalking, harassment, etc. If you file against another student (and “win”) they could be expelled or suspended but they could be fired if they are a faculty member. 

I (28) am a third-year graduate student and my ex narc (30) works at my university full-time. I finally left her a year ago after five years together, four of which we spent living together. 

For the last year I’ve been contemplating whether or not to file a Title IX complaint against her for mental and emotion abuse but have been on the fence bc of a lack of physical evidence and the process itself can be grueling and re-triggering. 

Last week I almost had a panic attack on campus during lecture bc the topic of discussion was highly triggering for me and it was the day of our anniversary. When I am already triggered on campus, knowing she’s physically there adds to the anxiety and panic even though her school is half a mile away from mine. It always just feels like she’s right around the corner. But this incident kind of solidified my decision to file bc the abuse is interfering with my education that I’ve fought and worked so hard for. I’ve had panic attacks on campus bc of her before, but my therapist and I are planning on starting EMDR therapy at the end of the month. So I’ll be reliving a lot of these experiences soon anyways, I might as well recount the abuse themes at the same time. 

I assume that most or all of us would like to see our nexes face some real consequences, but my main motivation for pursuing Title IX action is to ensure my safety on campus and protect what’s left of my grad school experience (she did her damndest to ruin my first year and the breakup and recovery over the last year really hindered a lot of my education, networking, professional work, and overall experience). Don’t get me wrong, it would be incredibly vindicating to see her face real consequences, but I know that I will never un-experience the trauma she caused me. So that is not what’s motivating this decision. 

Has anyone here sought Title IX or legal action against their nex? Did you get a “favorable” outcome? Any advice to share? 

I debated on whether or not to share my gender, but will because I know that it matters in a court of law whether we like it or not. We are both women so it may not be as “unusual” as a man pursuing justice against a woman.

5633,Is not reacting a manipulation tactic?,"I have reason to believe my boyfriend is emotionally abusive. I don’t think he means to but I’ve been reading “why does he do that” and I read about  something recent that has been happening to me. It’s been happening for a while, but whenever we get into arguments or we try to resolve conflict, he often tells me things like “I’m proud of myself because I’m remaining calm right now” “I’m trying to talk with you calmly” “I’m not angry I’m very calm right now..” Before I saw this as something good, that he was making an effort to not react in such a toxic way like yelling and such. Recently I’ve been wondering if he is just using that as a way to have something to hold over my head in arguments. This also doesn’t stop him from saying rude things, he just does it calmly and it feels more justified.

Yesterday, we got into a fight about me wanting to go to urgent care for my throat pain. He was very visibly annoyed and angry. I ended up going and when I got back we talked again and he was very calm. He said he was proud of himself this time because he was talking calmly unlike earlier on in the day. Later on in the argument, I was getting very frustrated with the conversation we were having because it felt like he just kept questioning the same things over and over and he just was disguising it as “I just want to understand…”

5690,I don’t understand what’s wrong with me,"My sons father has been abusive since right around when I found I was pregnant. He was always emotionally abusive but he started getting physical with me while I was pregnant. My son is now 2 1/2 years old now. And it has been on and off again times of abuse and the same with our relationship. He broke my hand while I was 4 months pregnant. He has treated me terrible and sometimes I wonder if maybe if I had been better it would’ve been different. The one time was really bad and I ended up calling the police. I got a temporary restraining order. He got assault charges against him. We had gone months without talking. When court came around for the permanent restraining order I dropped it and asked for civil restraint that would allow us to have contact regarding our son. Well that little bit of contact I allowed ended up getting me back to where I started. We were seeing each other again.  I asked the prosecutor to drop the charges and she did. We got a shared bank account, I let him use my credit cards. Ended up 5000 dollars in debt and no savings left.  While I’m taking care of him and his bills I found out he (21m) is cheating on me with a minor (16 or 17f). I left again. But nothing makes me happy anymore. It’s like I need him to be happy. I tried to distract myself with a rebound but now this guy is telling me he loves me and I just can’t commit cause I think one day I’m going to get back with my sons father because in my head “this is just what we do. One day we will get back together because there is no leaving.” My sons father tells me he hates me all the time but then he gets jealous if I’m just hanging out with a guy while we aren’t together.

5697,Am I wrong?,"
So my boyfriend (25M) and I (21F) have 2 kids together (2F & 6 month old F) and we have been together for 4 1/2 years.I have been recently smoking marijuana lately due to stress and today I had a friend over that I’ve known forever and she brought her 2 year old. My boyfriend does not like sharing drinks or food with ANYBODY including me, but he leaves water bottles half drank all over the house all the time and pretty much expects every water to be his in the house. So my friends son was thirsty he wanted water so he drank out of a new bottle but didn’t finish it, they left and I forgot about it, but it was still on the table. My boyfriend comes out and takes a sip out of it and I told him to stop and to spit it out. I told him that a kid drank out of it and he freaked out, he picked up the water bottle very roughly and stomped across the kitchen yelling at me ( he never hit me before but I thought that he might because he was so mad) he starting calling me stupid and saying I was so dumb and how could I be so stupid to leave that on the table where he could drink it. Then he stormed off and yelled that he was glade that we were over. He also started saying that I’m slow when I smoke and that’s all I think about now, but I don’t think that’s true because I only do it when I am about to have an anxiety attack.

5700,Was I wrong?,"I opened up about the abuse I'd been experiencing to a close friend of mine recently. I cried and poured my heart out, telling them how I'd felt so alone for months and months and that I didn't think I would have lived another week if I stayed. Their first words were, ""I want to hear his side of the story."" 

As far as I know, they've been going to see movies and hanging out with him and he keeps in contact with them regularly. They offered to ""moderate"" between the two of us but honestly I don't want to see him or be anywhere near his lies ever again. He destroyed me. I just thought I could tell someone what I was feeling but I don't think they believe me. I was sort of known as the ""uptight"" ""motherly"" one in my friend group, and my ex knows that.

 He could have easily told them that I was being sensitive or ""too serious"" and that he was just ""messing around"". He's told me that before. Was I wrong to tell them?

5701,"Did he truly change? I feel regret, was I wrong to let go this time?","Some background: My narc ex (25 M) and I (24 F) dated for 5 months towards the end of last year. We broke up due to how toxic it was and were in no contact for 7-8 months after. We ran into each other a month ago and apologized for how the last relationship went and decided to be friends. I noticed how much he changed. Completely new human, very nice and peaceful. He no longer seemed to have any toxic tendencies, so after some time we ended up getting back together. 


This time around, the relationship was so different. It was exactly how I hoped it would be. Calm, loving, nurturing, we gave each other space, communication, and even through arguments he would never get angry. But we ended up breaking up last night because we didn’t agree on the pace of the relationship. Even though we were together before, I wanted to slow the pace down and not get physical yet whereas he wanted to soon. I said I needed to feel fully there before being sexual whereas he thought being physical would help us get there. When I mentioned that I wanted to warm up to it, he said that felt like we were just platonic friends. 


We couldn’t find a compromise or meet in the middle so we agreed to disagree. We still love each other and he repeatedly told me I shouldn’t feel guilty or upset and that he wishes it was me but sometimes life doesn’t work out. He said he would do everything for me if I just warmed up to him, but I wasn’t ready and had to let go. It hurt a lot this time around as it wasn’t toxic, and it felt like he truly changed. We ended on good terms. Did I mess up by leaving? Did he truly change or is it a facade? 


TLDR: My narc ex and I broke up 7 months ago, were in no contact for 6 months, ran into each other, became friends and after seeing how much he’s changed we got back together. It was really smooth and peaceful this time, but he wanted to rush the physical while I wanted to wait a bit so we ended up breaking up because we couldn’t meet in the middle. It hurts because we ended on good terms. We still love each other. Did he truly change?

You would think that I would be able to recognize red flags from a mile away and run for my life, but no. I’ve never known or seen a healthy relationship—I truly cannot tell the difference between love and abuse and it’s terrifying. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years now. Deep down and even on the surface, I know that I’ve gotten myself into a mess. I’ve spoken to friends about some of his behaviour and they were repulsed and told me to leave him. I spoke to a psychiatrist about it because I was started to feel insane, I couldn’t tell if I was just paranoid from my childhood experience or if I was truly in an abusive relationship. He told me that the behaviours that I described were problematic, that I’m repeating dangerous patterns from my own childhood and that In his opinion I shouldn’t be in a relationship until I’m able to afford therapy to get treated. 

Yet, here I am. I broke up with him a week ago and was convinced that it was the right thing to do. But I ended up going back to him not even 48 hours later. I’ve never felt weak, I’ve been through a hell lot worse than this and came out strong. But I can’t recognize myself right now. I feel ashamed and disgusted, I don’t understand what’s wrong with me. I know it’s wrong, I know I have to end it, I know it’ll get worse as life gets more complicated but I’m hooked. I feel terrible if I hurt him and Im afraid to go back to being alone. I really do love him and we have a lot of great moments, he loves me like I’ve never been loved before. The sickest thing is that after everything I’ve said, I’m still afraid to make a mistake—that maybe I’m just paranoid.

5709,Was I in the wrong?,"I’m (f20) currently in a relationship with m19. He says I’m being manipulative. Here’s what happened. 

Whenever something happens when he hurts me, he always blames me. There was a point where I would ask to do activities with him and he would agree and then months would pass without us doing it. I brought it up to him and he said it was my fault for only bringing it up once when I have text message proof I brought it up multiple times. 

Another example is him calling me or making it known that he cares or loves me. He hasn’t taken any action and when I bring it up he gives all this reasons why to the point where I end up apologizing to him. He then says he understands and he’s sorry but this has been going on since at least last August. 

There have been other situations where he does something hurtful and he takes this “well you did this/you said that” approach and never takes responsibility and says others stuff such as “you’re reading too much into it” 

It’s gotten so bad that I texted him saying  that I’ll be the one to make plans and all the problems are on me. I genuinely think that because he’s never taken responsibility and he says me saying this is blatant manipulation. 

Is this abuse and manipulation from him? Or am I in the wrong?

I came out of a relationship with a narcissist a few months ago. I got a new therapist and I tried to open up about some of the things that went on. I told her how scary sexy was to me now... I had been raped in the past and my sexual boundary with my ex was I didn't want to have sex in similar situations. My ex rarely wanted to have sex, he didn't like intimacy in general. But sure enough, any time the one condition happened where I didn't want to have sex because it reminded me of my rape..he would push me into it until I gave in, no matter how much I would say no I don't want to..I would become a statue and just lay there and wait for it to be over. By the end of our relationship I didn't even want him to touch me and I avoided any situation that would lead to this scenario. 

I told my therapist about this and her response was ""a lot of women have sex to appease their partner even if they aren't into it"". Am I crazy, or is this totally different? I had my boundary disrespected and put into a situation by my so that reminded me of being raped.  

I have since left this therapist due to a string of issues and I start a new one next week, but I'm afraid my concerns will be dismissed again.

I wanted to have sex, but I'm an exhausted SAHM that also holds down a part time sometimes full time job and a part time delivery job. He's pissed because I wasn't energetic enough about his desire to prolong and complicate sex after i stayed up later than I wanted waiting for him to  come to bed. It quickly devolved into him telling me how awful I am. Now he is snoring while blasting the shittiest music from his phone because he knows it keeps me awake.

Imagine your long date friend was having a birthday party at this big reggaeton event, who you have known longer than your partner, with a few friends you have also known for years and would keep you safe.
Then you happily tell your partner that you are going to such birthday and they start giving you the “I am not comfortable” “Isn’t it basically just twerking over there” talk. Basically giving this idea that they would be insecure all night if you went and that you would be doing a big mistake if you went, even if you yourself have never been too fond of dancing like that and would rather swing around all night. Would you guys also feel at least a little manipulated into staying home and not having fun with the few girl friends you have?
And when you tell them that it just sounds manipulative and it seems like he wants you to stay home he tells you that he is just “insecure” and worried too much and it is offensive that you tell him it sounds just manipulative?

She acted like it was nothing. Told me she never noticed any of what I said. And that she doesn't believe me.

Is it really nothing? Was I overreacting??? Why do people online tell me it was abuse, then?? And I spent over 2y crying almost daily and suicidal, while telling myself it wasn't abuse. I still struggle with telling myself maybe i caused it, triggered him to treat me like that, that the things were small enough to still give reasonable doubt.

They're still together. I feel like until someone else who knows him comes forward and says he is abusive, I can't rest.

I don't wish innocents to be hurt but I wish she would tell me that it wasn't just me. He said his other ex could vouch for him, said I am crazy and irrational. But his other ex had left him pretty early on and he'd told me he'd been ""crazy in love with her"", he never even told me he cared about me when I kept saying how I felt.

His defense; he took my phone to not involve another party. Mine; he was ontop of me and it was the only way to get him off (I didn’t tell the cops this when they pushed questions about what caused me to feel like I needed to lay my hands on him). A third party who was there (coworker) was asked if he hit me, he said he didn’t see it (I was screaming for his help from the other room -it’s a one bedroom apartment), they asked if I hit him, he answered yes. They asked what provoked me to do that, he deflected and said “it all just happened so fast I guess because she was mad?” They asked why I was on the floor when they walked in the door, he deflected and said it happened so fast he just wanted to separate us. The third party later retracted those statements claiming he was under the influence of alcohol and would now see that he was wrong and made the narrative look poorly of me specifically. This happened in the month of November, the bf’s case was closed by the end of December. I had worse charges because 1) self incriminated/claimed by second party of physical assault 2) I didn’t tell the cops he was ontop of me because I knew he’d get into trouble if I told, my defense was “hear say” & 3) third party made claims pinning me as the assailant, case wasn’t closed until March the following year.

He said no he doesn't have to as I didn't give him money for a game. Then he ate all the food. I had none, and he told me to not cry to him and that it's not a big deal. I litterely can NOT give him money anymore. I need money to escape him. He used to force me to pay for his weed and I put a stop to it so now it's other things. I honestly would rather be dead than live with him anymore. I'm telling you now I'm going to end up killing myself during this isolation. I'm being fucking pushed over the edge with this. I can't NOT deal with this anymore. How do I avoid him in the same house. I have my own room. Hes going to want my $750 corona payment. I'm going to lie and say I didn't get it.

5760,Has anyone been wrong about abuse?,"UPDATE: Things have formally ended with the friend after she fired my sound guy without telling me and gave her boyfriend the job instead. Whilst I was ok with him being at my place of work, him having control of my microphone was not ok and this is just one violation too far.

Hi all my (33f) best friend (37f) is in a longish distance relationship with a guy (42m) who was abusive to his ex  and has done and said things to my friend that has given her multiple panic attacks over the last few months they've been dating.

My friend would phone me in tears from her work after he'd called her names, or put her down, or just disappeared and she couldn't get hold of him. This went on for months before I said anything to her about the relationship directly. They take a lot of drugs together at the weekends when they meet up, which I'm really worried about as she's on antidepressants. I'm not judging (I have been known to self medicate and found it useful), but she never did drugs before at all.

I've been in two abusive relationships and she says that's why I think he's abusive, and she's adamant that he's a good guy. I replied and upset her a few weeks ago by asking her what a healthy number of panic attacks is. 

Looking back, I wish I had been kinder to her as it has really affected our friendship, so we met up to talk it out, but she opened up and said some really nasty things to me over dinner that I am pretty sure have come from him. The way our friendship started several years ago she was criticising me for things that are totally opposite to how I am.

I'm not jealous of her, I am in a loving relationship, we both have lots of friends. I've talked to a few of them about him and most think he's creepy, but not all of them. And so what if he's creepy if he makes her happy. My partner says I should just let her go because of all the hurtful things she said to me and he thinks her boyfriend is an ""obvious bellend"" (lol I love my partner so much).

What if I'm wrong about all this? What if he isn't being abusive, and my friend is just not as nice a person as I thought she was? How do I support her if he is abusing her and gaslighting her though?

Has anyone been wrong about this before? What happened?

TL:DR - My best friend keeps getting panic attacks but is adamant I'm paranoid about her boyfriend even though he has a history of abusing his ex.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
5761,I’m not crying anymore. Is something wrong with me?,"I had been with my ex partner for 5 years. 3 years ago I bought a house for us with the intention of us being together and eventually marrying  and having kids....if we could get our relationship on track. 

The 5 years has been full of lots of ups and downs. It started as mental and verbal abuse then turned into physical abuse once we moved into the house. I used to tell him he was the meanest person I’ve ever met and I’ve never cried so much in my life until I got with him. 

Over the years I stopped telling him about things going on with my family and friends because when I did he would twist things and use them against me. Example once he told me I was having an emotional affair with a male friend I worked with since I talked to him everyday. This everyday wasn’t recent and I saw him everyday AT WORK! That’s all he needed to accuse me. 

He was also very neglectful to me. I used to beg for him to call me and spend time with me. He would flip it around and accuse me of being neglectful when truthfully I contacted him more. Eventually I started doing that less and just hung with my friends or myself. I just started lowering my expectations so I would get less disappointed by him. He still found ways to disappoint me. 

He never hit me but he broke my things, held me up against the wall, used intimidation and threats against me (I could go on). I had my last straw 2 weeks ago when he broke 3 things of mine in a span of 3 days and made threats. So I left. I’m still in the process of getting him out of my home. I have a protection order against him. 

I was really sad and crying daily up until 2 days ago. I don’t feel sadness. Is something wrong with me? I wanted to marry this person and have a family with him at one point and time. We even were engaged (I ended it last year but we stayed together). I know grieving is supposed to take a while...surely longer than a week and a half. I feel like during the relationship I learned how to forgive him and get past things quickly in order to proceed with the relationship. How do I stop doing that so I can properly heal and grieve? 

I have “broken up” ( I break up with him he doesn’t accept it so we stay together) with him many times over the years. It doesn’t really feel real sometimes and it’s hard to believe all of this has happened to me.",no,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,yes,yes,yes,yes
5763,Dealing with wrongful termination during leave of absence for victims of crime and domestic abuse,"I left my abusive partner 6 months ago and was granted a 1-year restraining order that prevents him from contacting my son or I. Until recently he abided by the order and I did not have any issues with him.

During the past month I started dating someone, and my ex somehow found out and was triggered. He calls and texts constantly, makes threats (I.e. claiming he can get a gun if he needs to), calls my son’s daycare, and walks back and forth on the sidewalk in front of my house. I have reported this all to the police, but they have not been able to locate him yet.

I let my boss know necessary details about the situation, explained that things have escalated, and requested a leave of absence for victims of crime and domestic abuse and violence (not sure if this is a national law, but my company observes it and the state I am in allows 2 weeks leave for victims of crime or domestic violence/abuse). My boss advised me to take the time I need and focus on myself and my son. He advised me not to worry about work and avoid checking work emails/phone calls. My boss informed my coworkers that I would be out of the office, but did not provide details.

6 days later I received a letter in the mail stating that I had failed to show up for work (we are working 100% remotely) and that I was being terminated for job abandonment. I was at a complete loss because my boss had approved this leave in advance,but additionally my state’s laws specifically state that advance notice is NOT required if the situation is an emergency or requires urgent attention (which was the case, and I have legal documentation to prove this).

I don’t know how to start dealing with this and am wondering if anyone has similar experience or advice. I already have enormous legal fees and cannot afford to be unemployed.

5768,Someone please tell me I’m not the only one who sees it,"This is from a Reddit post on another sub a couple hours ago and it gave me a lot of red flags and so were her comments because I think she might be getting abused but I don’t want to say that and be wrong, but it gave me a horrible feeling when I read her edit and it changed the whole tone of the post for me. Everyone was horrible to her in the comments except a select few. All of them downvoted her comments and refused to even listen to her and said she was a horrible wife. 

However One comment said that it was absolutely misogyny coming out of the woodwork because when this commenter had made a similar post a couple weeks ago, but on the other side where her boyfriend didn’t tell her he was not going to eat with her for dinner, and she turned to the sub to process her emotions, they told her she was a narcissist, that he didn’t owe her anything and that he can do whatever he wants, that’s she is abusive, manipulative and a horrible person. 

It sounds like this woman is in an abuse cycle and while maybe not physical she knows something is wrong..otherwise I don’t think she would have mentioned it.

5769,Seeking validation. Does this person sound abusive and does it seem like he admits to a previous time when he strangled me?,"Without going into full details, my ex strangled me. I peed my pants and almost lost consciousness but didn’t. I left the relationship. I later became pregnant by him after coerced sex and his refusal to wear a condom or pull out. Below is a conversation we had after the baby was born. He wanted to be involved and I was asking him to take accountability before I would agree to lifting the restraining order (yes I know we shouldn’t have been talking at all). I just need some outsiders’ perspective on this conversation and possibly a few others. I recorded part of the conversation (it’s a one-party consent state) and transcribed using Microsoft.

I'm just saying I can do the same thing that you're doing and going back to things in the past.

I feel happy though there are days I still just want to lay down and not get up. I have been talking about the abuse and SA I went through with my ex and still feel proud for getting my Protection order, I had to change my life yes but I did it for survival I wanted to live instead of dying with this man and his own insecurities and problems it was painful but once he caused me to miscarriage and hit me when I was holding his own daughter from a previous relationship I had to escape. But one thing one of my friends told me when I talked with her was that I wasn’t raped or SA because if your in a relationship with them then they can’t rape you even if you say no it bugged me because I remember crying and saying no infer and over again until I just drifted away in my head till he was done and I am pretty sure when you say no to sex it is rape regardless if you are in a relationship with them and she got extremely upset with me when I said this and ridicule me about it and now I am wondering if I am wrong I will bring this up in my therapy but I was wondering if anyone had any opinion on this and tell me if I am wrong?",no,no,yes,yes,yes,,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
5771,I feel rejected by the whole world and wish I could figure out what is bad about me,"
I don’t know, since my abusive ex dumped me in the worst way, I feel so ugly and undesirable and just disgusting. I didn’t have these feelings before. I find myself comparing to anyone on the street, wondering how they can be so happy and look wonderful and I look horrible from the outside and inside after this trauma.

I wish I could know what is wrong about me. I’m already spending lots of money on hair care, skin care, make up Etc and am in very good shape. But I feel so horrible, thinking that I must improve something about my appearance.


I feel like my abusive ex wouldn’t have dumped me if I had looked amazing. In reality, he dumps girls in only a few weeks or months.

Do you think there’s something objectively wrong about my appearance? I feel so ugly that I don’t want to go on the street. My abusive ex told me that No attractive guy would ever be into me because attractive guys are out of my league. Yet he showed off how beautiful I was in the beginning of our relationship.

Are my fears true? Is there something wrong about my appearance?

5772,Can’t wrap my head around a mail my abuser sent after I left: Do abusers actually believe they innocent/not at fault?,"I finally left my partner after 5 years of abuse. Emotional and physical, having to run from him and lock myself in the toilet or bathroom when he would start screaming at me.

It’s been 3 weeks now and I blocked all forms of contact with him. Except email, so 2 days ago I received an email from him. It stared with him saying that he is getting the feeling that I’m playing the victim (I am??). Furthermore, he wrote that the way we ended it was in a healthy manner (no?? I literally ran to my roommate because I was scared that he would attack me again). In the mail he also said that I shouldn’t speak bad about him to others and that it is disgusting if I would do that after a 5 year relationship.

Don’t get me wrong, I am in no way contacting him again and a police report has been filed already. I just can’t understand what he is thinking. Does he not see that his behavior, physical abuse, narcissistic traits have been the problem. That I am a victim?

5773,DV Case,"Hello, I (21 yr old female) and my husband (22 yr old male) are in a domestic violence case. I decided not to press charges and did not want a no contact order because it was very minor (not excusing his actions) abuse. We have been married a little over a year and half. The judge placed a no contact order where he is not allowed to contact me until the judge determines whether he can or not at the court hearing. I am wanting this to work and I am willing to forgive him since this was the first time this ever happened. My mom (unbeknownst to me) called him and asked what his intentions are with me and whether or not he wanted to be with me because she stated “I see how my daughter is and she is not okay so I needed to hear it as a mother so I know how to help her heal”. My mom told she did and told me what he said. He said “I love and care about your daughter, but I can’t think about being in a relationship with her” “ I could be facing jail time”. I love him, but I am going insane over here because here I am paying for his attorney, paying for all our shared bills ( minus the rent & utilities) and I get basically an IDK.

5774,"He is abusive, sends me into a panic attack, and then will record me. What can I do?","My ex who I live with (in the process of making sure he leaves for good) has been mentally and physically abusive but flips it on me.

Mentally: will say triggering things, pretty sure he is cheating on me and will laugh when I confront him and flip it on me, brings up everything “wrong” about me

Physically: pushes me if I say/do something he doesn’t like. Never been “punched” but have been grabbed as well as my belongings. He grabs my belongings and I will sit/hold onto them to stop him and he will throw me off of them. (He is 6’3, I am 5’2) for reference. My arms have been twisted, I have fallen on sharp objects… 

Anyways, after stuff like this happens I go into panic. My ex before him was the same way and used to beat me senseless, so I have some PTSD. 

During my panic attacks I sometimes scratch and hit at myself without noticing. (Yes, seeing a therapist) I also push him out of the way when he is trying to grab things from my closet or room and I will block the door so he doesn’t grab my stuff. Which looks bad to someone who doesn’t know what happened minutes before. He will tell me he is grabbing his stuff but then will grab mine too. He laughs while doing this and makes jokes too. It’s triggering… 

He records all of this. He records the parts I do wrong. And now I’m concerned he will try to frame me and act as if he is purely innocent.

I have pictures of bruises on my body from being pushed/grabbed but not sure how far that will go. I also have a video of me asking him to leave (It’s my house I own) and him ignoring.

5776,"Help, I can't stop breaking no contact.","***\*\*all context can be found in my original post*** [***here***](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/15m6ijq/i_left_him_2_weeks_ago_and_i_cant_stop_breaking/)

I'm making this post to be separated from my original in hopes that some of you have gone through exactly what I'm feeling/thinking and know how to combat it so that I don't keep hurting myself by communicating with my abuser. We even have a temporary no contact order in place until his criminal hearing, but we've both broken it. I want to stop. I need to.

I swear, it's like a drug. I try so hard, I block him everywhere but he finds ways to reach out to me and he assumes I'm ""cheating"". I've already tried a friend's advice and called him and told him I didnt want to be with him anymore, to which he threatened suicide. It was so scary he literally was telling me to call an ambulance and everything. He's insane. He literally makes new email addresses, downloads apps to get a new temporary phone number, etc. 

But here's the thing: I did truly, and fully love him. I never did him wrong, I never wanted to. All I wanted was to be treated as someone of value whom he adored, and he only did that to kiss up for doing something wrong or to kiss ass so he could go out by himself.

I try to remind myself of how horrible this person is, how many times he's left me to cry alone after he said/did something that hurt me, etc. The catalyst to all of this was him beating me and strangling me, but I ***STILL*** can't help but want to talk to him. Like what the hell??? I advise you skim my original post to see what all he did/context on who I'm dealing with here. He's definitely a narcissist, no doubt about it. 

Please, I NEED to cut all ties for the sake of myself, my sanity, and my 3 month old daughter. She does not need to have trauma of seeing her daddy beat her mommy.

But what is it that makes me feel bad for him? Why do I get upset thinking about him with someone else potentially in the future?

Now it’s happened again Friday, where I kept telling him (my now ex boyfriend M 24) I didn’t want to have sex and he forced me again. I decided to go to the police and file a rape charge and took a rape kit. (No charges have been pressed at this moment) 
I have so much guilt because he is somebody I love so dearly. I don’t want to ruin is life. 
I made a mistake by telling him I filed charges on him, and he pretty much threatened that he would win the case, sue me for defamation and take every bit of money I have left. He called me on No caller ID at least 20x, called off different phones, and sent me that text through google voice. 
I told him what he did to me was coercive rape, and I repeatedly said no but he continued and I went along with it. He keeps saying it was consensual, and that I’m trying to ruin his life because I found out he was cheating on me, but even before i’m my previous post - I didn’t even know he was cheating and it still felt wrong that we had sex. 
I don’t know if coercive rape is illegal and what case I would have against him, I feel confused because we were in a relationship, but I know that “no means no” , but would this be a “he said she said type of ordeal? It’s the weekend and I haven’t been able to get ahold of my detective. 
I feel so anxious and my heart races thinking about this. Deep down, I know everything he did to me was wrong- but I feel horrible if I continue to press charges and ruin his life.

5785,tw: childhood trauma/molestation.. please help me,"im in my 20s now, but about 10 years ago when I was younger I was the duff of my friend groups, meaning I didn't get much attention from guys, when I did it was surface level ie they were interested in my body and nothing more. we visited family in a different country almost every year, and I have an older (by 5years) male cousin who was there. at first I thought we were just close as cousins but then it changed and he would touch my legs or my thighs or whatever and at the time I believed I was in love with him, and this continued every time we visited for like 4 years. I remember being angry that my soul mate was born as my cousin, and upset that I had to keep quiet about our relationship because I knew all my friends would say is ""ew he's your cousin"". 

Fast forward to now, I know that all of what happened was wrong, I no longer speak to this cousin because as the years went by I waited for him (the older and more responsible one) to end things, but he continued on until I had to end them. I ended them bc I was reaching the point where I understood how wrong it was, plus there was an incident where he tried to wake me up to have sex and before that all we ever did was touch each other and that made me so uncomfortable and was my first red flag.

I have finally managed to speak with my mom about what happened and the family discussions have began.. but what i need help with is that i feel SO GUILTY. even though I am aware that my cousin was older than me and should've known better, in my head its like we both wanted the relationship and now I'm letting him take the fall.. i just need help, I really don't know what to do..

Since it was in relation to fighting me to stay home from school, and the bus came and went, I emailed the school and briefly explained the situation. When I spoke to them, we discussed past behaviors, where my child learned and witnessed violence, and that we are all recovering and trying to build a calm home (me and my kids). They were understanding and helpful, and then they kind of tried the “scare them straight” approach with my kid...which just upset him further...we met with his therapist who helped us process things a little but, it’s just very hard to live with over time (I know some of you are moms of kids with special needs and know where I’m coming from!!)

A day later, nerves are calmed, we are talking about it and working through it, and Nex (his dad) is talking to him about it too. Nex emails a long diatribe that I shouldn’t have told the school our kid was violent, it puts our family in a bad light, it punishes our kid, they’ll treat him badly, etc etc...it’s of course, really all about not wanting his own violence to be exposed. Anything to stay in denial that his abusive actions seriously damaged me and our kids. Listen, I’d rather leave it in the past too, but here we are.

Everything made sense. One day I didn’t listen to him and he threatened to divorce me. I knew that it was over after that day. I found a lawyer and told him I wanted out. Last night he told me He’s going to leave his mom and get us a place, even if that means his family will cut him off. I’m sorry I’ve never done anything wrong to his family so why would they do that. Then he told me that if he does something drastic like rent an apartment for us, he will have high expectations and I have to make sure he’s always happy.

He has 4 other siblings and one is single) He also said that his family is his family regardless but he can lose his wife and kids and he doesn’t want that.

5795,It’s never over,"I have been reading this thread for a long while now.  I sometimes take little hints of advice with me along the way, but mostly to see if there is anyone out there that may be going through even a hint of what I do daily with my narcissist ex husband. We are going on three years post divorce and it’s still a struggle most days than not. Some days I feel like I can take on the world because I got out of that abusive, controlling, unhealthy environment and am taking on the world by myself. Other days not so much. I live by the grey rock method and find that to be the most effective way in dealing with a TRUE narc, however he is relentless! It. Just. Never. Stops. 

We have two children together, 9 and 13. I know in my heart that I made the right decision because I slowly see some of his bad behavior fading in them with each passing year. I am finally the mother I’ve always dreamed of being. We laugh and play and joke. However, the abuse they still go through kills me! He plays the same mind games with them all the time. They are constantly feeling sorry for him and trying not to make him angry. Most people don’t understand, but it literally breaks my heart to see this. I know what that feels like because I’ve lived it and it’s exhausting, frustrating, and sometimes intolerable. I need advice on how to deal with this. 

He is their father and I am still ashamed and embarrassed to admit some of the things he told them and did to them to try to alienate me at the beginning.

5796,"Gaslighting is no joke, you guys","Oh, man, I thought I was doing so well, too.  It's been 6 months since I left my nex, moved to a new town, I don't miss him anymore, divorce proceeding are going ok, have been doing good about only contacting him when it's about the kids, I even managed to tolerate doing some shared parenting time at my kid's birthday party without feeling bad....

But recently my mom (I'm staying with my parents while I get back on my feet) asked me to start making sure the dog's lead was untangled when I let him in the house.  No problem.  And today when I went outside to get him he was really tangled up in some trees and bushes.  So after I let him in I went back out and walked around unwinding the lead from everywhere it got caught, and left it, wrapped up in circle next to the back door.  Then I went about my day.

Less than an hour later, my mom tells me ""Please remember to untangle the dog lead when you let him in.  I had to untangle it again just now.""

""You found it that way today, like just now?"" I say.

""Yes""

""In the back??"" I say, starting to freak out.

""Yes...""

Then I just completely lose it.  I run upstairs crying, trying to figure out why I had a memory of doing something my mom says I didn't do.  Was I crazy?  Was I sick, or getting early onset dementia?  Is she also gaslighting me?? (After leaving my nex I suddenly seemed to ""misplace"" things less often and hardly anyone has been questioning my memory so I had just started to trust myself again.)  Then my mom heard me crying and came to talk to me, and I was sobbing, and wailing,  and carrying on about how there's something wrong with me, that I can't remember anything, that I needed to see a doctor...  Over a dog lead.

We talked it over and it was just a miscommunication about our differences interpreting the word ""untangled."" It was actually fine, except that I freaked my mom out by flipping out like a crazy person over it

I can't believe, that after all the progress I've made, how quickly I can still crumble from just the memory of my emotional abuse.

5800,Nex in midst of another divorce possibly hoovering?,"

My nex is going through another divorce. Ever since he's announced it to me, he's been a lot more kinder in his tone when he initiates contact. Tells me we should be ""friends"", consistently trying to engage in conversation with me during pickups. His tone in messages is even more cooperative (again, only when he initiates. It's quite different if I communicate an issue). 

Lately, every time he picks up our daughter, he gets that soft tone of voice, tilts his head, even puts his chin on his hands in that manipulative body language trying to get me to open up and talk with him. He asks me questions about myself, tells me how good I look, tells me that he's been getting help in therapy, etc. I don't typically  respond with words. I nod, I acknowledge, I say a generic, ""that's good"" and I quickly switch the conversation to my daughter and tell her my goodbyes, etc. 

Today he tried it again. It angers me. Not him so much. I know him for what he is. But the fact that I may somehow still communicating to him that I'm weak, that I'm fair game is what is really getting to me. 

I thought I'd grown so much since he'd abandoned us, literally homeless. It is hurting me to think that I haven't grown as much as I thought I had. My eyes are teared up ever since he left a half hour ago. It's crazy. He didn't even TECHNICALLY do anything that anyone would consider wrong. Just the fact that I know him and how his mind works is what's getting me.  It's what his actions communicate to me about MYSELF that is hurting me. 

I've done a lot of research on narcs, done a lot of research on the personality traits that attract them, I've done so much self reflection and his actions lately are making me feel like I've gotten nowhere. 

Maybe that's his game. He is highly intelligent and strategic. He loves the long game, always has.

5801,I broke my arm. Everything that can go wrong is.,"This is going to be long sorry. Thank you if you do read it all.


So I broke my arm around last Wednesday. I also ended up losing my phone that day. I was able to get my phone back but it took a lot of effort and having to contact my parents which I did not want to do but desperate times comes with desperate measures. So at least now I have my phone back. I broke my dominant hand and I can’t really do much of anything now. I had surgery on my left hand before and I had to do things with one hand so im sort of used to it.

I am worried that I can’t clean the house though and that makes me really nervous. I also can’t really do much of anything. My husband isn’t… The best. If you seen my previous post, do you know what’s been going on so far. 

He also hasn’t been great at like sharing work or mental loads. So I pretty much do everything in the house and now I’m worried that nothing is gonna get done and it’s gonna be gross and I’m gonna get anxious and I’m not gonna be able to take care of myself properly. I have cats too so I’m worried about their grooming and stuff like I can kind of feed them, but grooming them is really hard now.

I was also supposed to have one more conversation with him about couples counseling even though imI should give up. A therapist thinks it’s good to just have one more conversation to get it all cleared off the. my therapist thinks it’s good to just have one more conversation to get it all off my chest etc. 
I’m too scared to talk to him with my hand like this. It just feels unsafe. I don’t know why he’s never been physically violent.

The same day that I broke my arm and lost my phone. I also had a really really bad dissociative day. The night before something else happened at night… And I guess I was triggered really badly because this is the worst I’ve been in a while.

It’s just hard and scary and feels bad .

5802,I FINALLY LEFT,"Hi everyone! I’m not sure who all will remember the posts I made about my awful boyfriend (all were deleted because I wimped out and took him back continuously, sorry guys), but we are finally over! It happened last night, we were just talking after we both got off work and he switched on me and flipped out as he often would. The name-calling, cruel words, etc. At first I was sad and started crying, but it was like I suddenly had this huge epiphany where I realized I’m just done. I thought I could change him, I had hope that he’d do the right thing and then I hoped that I could change enough so that he would love me the way that I wanted him to. However, I realized that I’m never going to be good enough because it’s nothing I’m doing, he’s just a bad person. I could be as perfect as humanly possible and he’d still find something I did wrong or find another way to make fun of my insecurities. I don’t want that anymore. I hung up and turned off my phone immediately. When I woke up this morning, I blocked him on everything. 

I feel good right now. I just felt tired last night. I’m still partially worried that in a few hours or days I’ll run back to him, but it feels different this time. I also will be starting therapy soon, I’ve always struggled with anxiety but these past 6-7 months have brought my mental health to places I didn’t know it could enter. I have a good support system, my sister never liked him anyway lol. 

Thanks again for everyone’s advice and warnings over the past months, I’m sorry it took me this long to utilize them.

5806,I (22F) think I’ve met the love of my life (22M). How do I hold onto this?,"In December, I (22F) asked a friend of mine to set me up with her friend (22M) because I thought he was cute. I had been unlucky in love - a massive breakup the year before then all the messy fun that comes with being single. I told this same friend just a week before that I didn’t believe in love. 

Boy, was I wrong. 
From the first blind date to now, I’ve been in awe of this man, his devotion, his compassion, just everything (I could gush forever!). We spend almost all of our time together; he’s my best friend. I thought I knew what love was (I had been in a 2 year relationship!) - but I’ve been shown a new, thoughtful, kind love that has made me rethink my entire life. 

My friends have all noticed how smitten I am. I’m as happy as a clam and can’t help but be in a great mood almost all the time. He just brightens my life!

Now, we’ve been together since December and are probably out of the honeymoon phase (hello, first fight!). Even though the rosy bubble burst, I am no less in love. He keeps me grinning like a maniac. It’s harder now, sure, we disagree and he can annoy me, but I want to end every day in his arms. 

Reddit, how do I hold onto this? People with long term partners, what’s your secret to making the relationship last? 

We’re both about to graduate from college - I might move to New York. Things are bound to change, but I want to remain steadfast in my love!

5810,My (25f) boyfriend (27m) made a comment about my body and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting?,"So, I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (27m) for 3 years. He has always complimented my body and says he thinks it’s sexy. He has never made any negative comments about it. I am underweight (not by choice, I have medical problems that cause me to have a practically non-existent appetite and it’s extremely hard for me to gain weight). I have been trying to gain weight though, to feel healthier and better. With the fact that I’m underweight, it also means I don’t have much boobs or butt. But my boyfriend never seemed to have a problem with that. Yesterday, however, I was talking again about how I really want to gain weight and how im trying and stuff like that. And he says something like then your boobs will get bigger or it’ll go to your boobs or something like that. And I said that that’s not really how it works, and everybody’s weight distributes differently depending on your body type, and with my body type it probably wouldn’t go to my boobs or butt for quite a long time. It’d most likely go to my stomach first as I have seen in the past when I used to weigh more. He insisted that it would go to those places, and said he is “manifesting” the weight to go to my boobs so that they will be bigger. This kind of made my heart hurt. Like in that moment I felt like he wants a girl with bigger boobs and a bigger butt, even though he has never criticized my body before. Like why is it important where my weight goes? For me it’s about being healthyand feeling good. Now I’m feeling really self conscious. I can’t help thinking he prefers big boobs. He has even admitted before that he sometimes can’t help but look if a girl has a lot of cleavage. So I’m just wondering, am I overreacting and this is actually not a big deal? Should I forget about this? 

Tldr; my boyfriend has always only said positive things about my body, but yesterday my boyfriend made a comment about my body that rubbed me the wrong way and I’m not sure how to feel about it.

5811,I (34f) feel like I should be mad my long term bf (36m) cheated on me. I'm not and I feel weird that I don't. What do I do here?,"About a month ago, my boyfriend of 6 years came home from a business trip. He looked terrible and I asked what was up. He admitted he cheated on me with a woman he met on the trip, and just kind of broke down crying. I was in too much shock to react at the time, but kind of figured I'd feel the rage when I got over how unexpected this was. To my knowledge, he's never cheated, never even given me cause for suspicion.



Ever since then, he's been walking on eggshells, practically jumping in fear if I so much as frown. He's tried to apologize for it and offer any sort of oversight or whatever I think is reasonable, and I just find myself not really caring. And I don't mean in like a ""I'm so angry at you I don't care what you do anymore"" sort of way. I don't feel hurt, or angry, or even betrayed. If anything, I'm most annoyed that he's so different since then, and I'd really just like to go back to the way things were, to have that playful, fun, smart guy I knew around.



I'm not sure what's wrong with me. I mean, he cheated on me, right? That's an awful thing, and he is certainly treating it like it's the end of our relationship and I think he's just offering me the chance to boot him rather than leave. But like, oh, I had to get an STD test to make sure nothing got passed along and life went on. I even asked myself last night if I'd be mad if he cheated on me again, and the emotional databank is pointing to 'no'. And that's crazy, right? Like, I'm trying to set my own reactions around because I'm reasonably sure my reactions are insane here, but that doesn't leave me much to go on. And I can't exactly ask my friends and family because they'd jump to all sorts of places I don't really want to go, insist that I throw him out so hard he'd bounce twice, and I don't want to do that.

5826,I found out he cheated on me two days ago,"before i preface this, it was understood that watching porn/ liking half naked women on social media is considered cheating to me. to each their own but i wholeheartedly consider it cheating, you are actively lusting over another person and using their body as a way to pleasure yourself and it was agreed that he thought the same, so it went both ways.

i don't know what i did wrong really, i think i was perfect to the best of my abilities. i'd supply him with a home cooked meal every time, i would consider myself a very pretty woman and i would doll up regularly, we have a great sex life, more than 3 times a week and if he certainly wanted more of it, i would happily do it. 

i know i'm not perfect but i tried my best to be. he would tell me how every person he's dated was child's play compared to what we have. how no other woman exists to him, looking at another woman makes him sick. 

but i found his history tab and there's just so much porn, porn of these women who look nothing like me, it's all too much. i don't even want to go into detail.

he was apologetic and he vowed to never do it and he saw it as normal. he promised to be utterly devoted to me. as of that night, he's been devoted, we've been inseparable. he takes me out to the park and we've cooked together.

but every time i close my eyes, i see other women, how do you make it stop? i love him dearly but it eats me up. does it ever get better? is a happily ever after possible after this? how do i make sure the despair doesn't ruin me?",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
5828,He wants to call me whenever he’s feeling weak,"My partner has come clean about his infidelity and porn addiction a couple months ago when I found out he was also messaging another woman from his past with ill intention. He apparently had come clean about everything going back to the beginning of our relationship. We are married with kids. It was one of the hardest times for me. I told him we would continue, try to recover from this but I would be working on myself for me and that we are not 100% in the safe zone. We could be a year from now and I decide this relationship is not for me.

Now to my dilemma. I am going on vacation with our children for two whole months to our home country. I confess and have also confessed to him that I am feeling insecure for the time he’ll be here alone. He has reassured me time and time again that he has not looked at any porn and has had no desire to seek anything of its sort.

But today he asked me a question. He asked if he called me while I was away saying he was feeling weak, that he needed strength for his temptations because he misses me, etc., would I be there to hear him out and reaffirm to him that he’s strong enough and that he can get through it without porn or seeking out other women to talk to.

I don’t know. It rubbed me the wrong way. I didn’t know how to feel. I said I appreciate him being 100% transparent as that’s what I wanted anyways. I said I would but… that I would like him to have an accountability person here as well, a friend. 

Is this a good thing? Progress? Am I being insecure for no reason? I feel like it shouldn’t be hard to respect your partner.

5830,Two wrongs don’t make a right…,"Two wrongs don’t make a right…

So this is a really long story… my (29F) husband (32M) and I have been together for over 9 years, married for 3. We have two beautiful daughters together. It really was love at first sight. I truly believe that we are soulmates. 

However, after having our first child at 22, I struggled with body image, confidence, and PPD. I had an emotional affair with a coworker that we shared. It never got physical, but my husband doesn’t believe that and is 1000% convinced that it was. We never properly dealt with that and has always haunted our relationship since. 

Fast forward and I am working somewhere where I don’t feel appreciated and feel taken advantage of. I get a new job for a great company that I feel appreciated and that I’m doing a good job. I even received an award from the owners. My husband mistook my excitement for the new job as excitement for my coworker. Instead of being supportive and proud of me, he accused me of sleeping with my coworker at work, stores, car, everywhere. Even on our daughter’s birthday. He planted tracking devices, threatened my coworker, put recording devices in my office (which he says he can hear physical relations but they never happened so idk what he hears…), so much so that my coworker filed for an OOP and I was fired. 

Due to the trauma of the past, he cannot see that I would never do the things he has accused me of. He is so incredibly hurt and mad about what he believes that he has called me names, broken stuff in our house, slapped me, and he then turned around and cheated on me multiple times, including once in our bed. There is so much more to the story, but the just of it is that I did not do what he thinks but he has done more… and he thinks therapy is a waste of time and money… Everyone I have talked to about this says that there is no hope and that I should just leave… but he is it for me. He is my one. I’m so lost and hurt and idk what to do anymore… I feel like I don’t even know him anymore and that the person I love, my husband, is gone…

I was reading an article about why men cheat https://www.elitedaily.com/dating/why-do-men-cheat/1406633 and read that even men who love their wives, cheat. I thought of Ross and Rachel. How terribly broken she was when she learned he slept with someone while she was missing him wanting to reconcile.

She spent years chasing different people but in the end ultimately what she had with Ross despite his betrayal, was so special she didn’t have that with anyone else. And they ended up together.

There’s something truly wrong with people who don’t care about how they effect others especially those who they work with and interact with in social settings. I never heard anyone say that before so I was kind of floored and my brain in its own way definitely sent me signals that that behavior is abnormal and not okay. Secondly he told me that the women in his past if they knew that he had “other women” none of them responded the way I did. And we as humans how we respond to hurt and betrayal is literally flight or fight so if these women were as passive as he makes them seem I still can’t form a clear picture of what his past relationships look like.

5873,Intuition when with someone vs when apart from them,"One of the things I learnt from my NPD dating experience was that really, before any very clear red flags have occurred, I had a strong feeling in the back of my mind that something is wrong and it gets louder to the point that I might even leave them before they get a chance to show their true colours. This has occurred for me twice and both times, later events confirmed what they were, in one case it was a formal diagnosis of NPD which gave me a lot of confidence in my intuition.

However, almost 100% of the time when I am dating someone, I will at some point go through a period of paranoia, often very intense, even though they turned out to be completely harmless and normal in the end.

I really struggle to differentiate between good intuition and paranoia now. One thing I have been thinking about is that with the two narcs I dated, I got the heebie jeebies when with them in person. I didn't want to hang out with them for long periods of time, I didn't feel relaxed and easy with them, even if I enjoyed aspects of being with them. When they left my house I felt relief.

It seems to be that I get paranoid about others, who are ""normal"" in the end, when \*not\* around them - stewing and ruminating on various things they said or other ""clues"" - but then when with them in person again I felt pretty calm and comfortable.

5879,I (F25) slapped my husband (M30) in self defense. I'd it okay to feel guilty?,"I (F25) slapped my Husband (M30) in self defense. Why do I feel so guilty?

My Husband hit me, and I hit him back in defense. Is it normal to feel guilty?

My husband has a really bad temper. He had hit my face and tried to strangle me over an argument a couple months ago. This was the first time he had laid his hands on me. I was in such a shock, I didn't know what to do other than warn him that if something like this ever happens again, I will not tolerate it. I was really hoping this was the last time, but it wasn't. Despite living under one roof, we haven't been on talking terms for the past 6 months. Every month, I was trying to fix things with him, but he never wanted to. I ultimately got fed up of him ignoring me that I broke down and sent him texts begging him to start this new year off in a positive note. He would'nt hear me out in person, he always shuts me down or just ignores me. He comes back home livid. 

He comes back home, livid. It was 1 in the morning and he starts to blast the volume on the TV. I told him to turn it down because I have a migraine and he ignores me. I ask him again, and he starts to cuss at me, calling me so many names. At this point I lose my cool and cuss back at him because the only time he wanted to talk to me, was only to insult and disrespect me. He then comes close to my face and tells me to call him a name again. I told him to back off, and he didn't listen, so I gave him  what he wanted to hear. He proceeds to go for my neck once again, and this is when I push him back and slap and kick him. He stands back for a good 20 seconds when he slaps me. I also slap him back, harder and on both sides. After this altercation, I got back to bed, with my heart beating really fast and my hands shaking. My anxiety had gotten so bad. I loved this man.

5881,i feel weaker than i know i am.,"I’ve had two boyfriends, ever. my first one was extremely abusive the majority of our year long relationship. when the night came he made me look unrecognizable I knew if I didn’t leave he would eventually take my life so I packed my bags and drove straight to my moms house. I swore I never would let that happen to me again. 
four years later and my now boyfriend, of a year and a half, choked me a couple weeks ago. he stoped once he realized I couldn’t breathe and my throat hurt for a week afterwards. he’s never been abusive before or since then, he doesn’t even cuss at me. And I keep finding myself saying “well at least he didn’t do what the last one did”, when it doesn’t matter, it’s still wrong! I don’t know what to do. I love him, I know he loves me. He cares for me, supports me but I just cannot forget or let go what happened. I know the statistics. I know he will most likely do it again. then I question myself, I’m 23 and the two guys I’ve loved have physically harmed me. Am I the problem, is it me? Are questions I’ve been asking myself, which I also know is not right. My mind is a constant battle. Please give me some advice and encouragement!!!

5884,It finally happened,"I feel stupid. I should have trusted my instincts.

We'd been fighting a lot recently. Every time it got heated, I would start looking for his wrists.... I can't explain it. I felt safer if I did that. I honestly don't think I was doing it intentionally at first. I just somehow started trying to hold his hands, making sure he wasn't gesturing too much while we got into it. he always grabbed my face to look at him and I wanted to stop him I guess

Then he got frustrated with me tonight, pulled my hands away from him, and slapped me near my eye/head and yelled at me. I just sat very quiet and still and said okay and I'm sorry. He hit me pretty hard. I feel so stupid.

It's like my body was trying to tell me, you need to watch out, and I just ignored it. My body knew before my heart did that he would do this. I didn't know this was a symptom. I never saw anyone else do it before or talk about it

We just made up and he apologized but what now? I'll never feel safe with him when we fight again. How could I feel safe? He said he would never ever do it again and it was a mistake. And you know what he said.. to keep my hands off him because it just makes him madder and more frustrated when we're fighting. It's like he wants free reign to hurt me if he wants and I'm wrong for trying to stop him. It's not like I was doing it on purpose anyway.. my body was moving before I was even trying to

5885,I don't want to overreact... or underreact. (First-time things got physical),"We (35F)(30M) have been married for 3 years. He is one of those *""is always right""* guys, and has clearly repressed anger issues. He is a hothead and quick to anger, but he is going to therapy (it was either that or separation) and it's helping him. He is a good husband and I love him, and I am able to handle him as I am older and more experienced when it comes to relationships, also because I have a very *""this isn't worth getting angry over""* attitude towards life in general, so I am able to diffuse any tension rather quickly. However...

He has been diagnosed with a life-altering long-term disease lately *(nothing lethal, just life quality adjustment has to be made)* and naturally, he hasn't been in the best of moods. Especially nowadays, after a strong dose of treatment, he is suffering from side effects and is in a nasty mood. I am doing everything to make him feel better, as he calls me ""the perfect wife"".

Tonight, I was cooking, and we got into a stupid argument about how the oven works. Fine, as usual, he is insisting he is right. We are not screaming or yelling, just talking back and forth. I was tired, and the conversation was not going anywhere, I was clearly right (I know how the oven works, I am the one cooking a lot), so I just told him ""Can't you just admit you are wrong and let this go?""...

Well, that did not go well. He violently grabbed my face between his hands (not necessarily painful, but sudden and very aggressive and threatening way), and screamed to my face ""CAN'T YOU JUST ADMIT YOU ARE WRONG AND LET THIS ONE GO!"" I backed away dumbfounded and scared, and he stormed off the kitchen.

In a couple of minutes, he said he wanted to talk and he apologized. I told him I could ignore many of his annoying behaviors, but violence was not one of them, and he should stay away from me for a while.

I am upset, and a bit scared, because it was very sudden and unexpected at that moment, but sadly not completely surprising considering his anger issues. 

However, **I have a history of ""*****underreacting*****"" to things and being too forgiving**. My anger already had subsided (this was about an hour ago), but I feel if I underreact to this it might cause him to relax too easily without actually sitting in his thoughts and realizing what he did was not okay. 

Where do I go from here? What is the appropriate amount of time I should be distant? Should I ask him to bring this up in his therapy?

5886,My (30m) fiance shoved and strangled me (28f) during a heated argument because I wouldn't let him leave,"We had an argument before he had to leave for work, and I was so upset that I couldn't let him go. I kept urging him to calm down and not leave while we were still in that heated state. Despite my pleas, he insisted on leaving, stating that it wasn't what he needed right then and he had to go. Eventually, I reluctantly agreed, but I emphasized that I didn't want him to depart in anger with unresolved issues hanging in the air. I continued to ask him to calm down, hoping for a reconciliation, and as I moved in for a hug, he shoved me, causing me to fall to the floor.

His frustration escalated to the point where he ended up strangling me. After this disturbing incident, he left, only to return home an hour later without going to work. Throughout the day, he neither apologized nor acknowledged what had happened, choosing to ignore me instead.

I've consistently struggled with giving him space when he's upset during an argument. The challenge stems from the fact that, in those moments, I'm also upset, and what I crave is comfort and a discussion about the issue. I'm even fine with not delving into the details; it's the standstill that triggers my anxiety and abandonment issues. I've communicated to him multiple times that I would be okay if he simply left in a considerate, kind, manner, as it fulfills his need for space without causing additional distress on my end.

This was the first time he laid a hand on me during an argument, though I've been aware of his struggles with anger management, I'm questioning whether I might be to blame for provoking him during such a heated moment. Or for not giving him the space he asked for when he was trying to manage his anger, or if I was being too needy and inconsiderate.

5889,Everything that can go wrong is going wrong,"I want to cry, scream and give up at this point. I’ve been homeless since Aug 2022. This is due to DV only as I had an apt in my name. I finally got a job that just ended as it was seasonal and found an apartment that an organization was going to pay for me and I get into a fight with a resident that put her hands on me first, hit me in the face with a bottle, ripped out my hair and bit me. They called the cops and only made me move out and let her stay. Police say I have a misdemeanor charge. I had to move back in with my abuser because there are no shelters available in Chicago. I decided to leave my abuser yesterday because he split my lip open, blacked my eye and ruptured my ear drum because I wouldn’t sleep with him and he gets angry when I don’t. I left with nothing. I can’t get a ride from 311 to a shelter because I stupidly picked a motel in Schiller park and they don’t pick there. So I stayed over night and found a shelter in southern Il. I get an Uber and the driver never shows up and they take $334 from me. I’m outside in the cold with my kid and I just want to die and give up. I don’t know what to do other than go back to him or let her stay with him. My family is out of state and doesn’t want anything to do with me for 3 
years now because they don’t like abuser.

Edit 

They give me the money back and I made it to the shelter but my ex knows exactly where I am somehow because although I used Lyft he was able to get a receipt of my ride and I don’t understand how? I put my cash app card information on his uber eats app (I didn’t want to) but that’s it. How can he track my ride? Do I need a new debit card? It’s the only card I have. I don’t have money to keep running.

5892,How to move on,"I'm not sure what to do. I've suffered mentally abusive relationships in the past. The longedt one lasting 7 years. I worked through my issues and realised how I was contributing to the abuse by allowing myself to be part of such relationships.

Suffice to say, I've been single now for 8 years because I can spot the red flags and I'm hyper vigilant.

There is one relationship that I had, that's really holding me back from trusting a man again.
It was a short one 6 months or so, back in 2007.
He would spike my beer with vodka. He lived in the same town as my family. So we'd go out with them and because of this, I'd end up severely drunk and make a fool out of myself on front of family.
It got to the point where people would say ""you were really drunk last night"" ""what's going on"".
I said terrible things because I was so drunk.

I didn't know what was happening, so I'd watch my drinks, but before I knew it, id be blackout drunk.
It was so scary and I thought there was something wrong with me (liver not working, alcoholism)

Then one evening, I was with him and I get a text from my sister telling me not to drink the drink in front of me. He had been spotted by a mutual friend putting 2 shots of vodka in my beer.

I left the ""relationship"" immediately and moved on. However I'm really affected by this now. It's like it's been brewing and I'm so full of anger and rage about it. I think about it every couple of days.

5893,Play fighting gone wrong,"So one night while me and my boyfriend were buzzed during maybe.. the second month of us dating? We began to play fight. He knows he's more agile, more skilled in sports, and more powerful than I am so I tried my best and wanted to intimidate him a little. We were slap boxing, so he was finding my openings and giving me small little smacks and it was getting me into a hypervigilant kind of mood (I have PTSD) so I was trying to get to his level because he was obviously trying to dominate the situation and me, and I accidentally gave him the back of my hand and he literally IMMEDIATELY after did this thing where when I twirled around and met his eyes again, he put out his leg and kicked me so hard right in my uterus area/lower stomach. I had fibroids at the time that were healing and after he did this, they started bleeding again.. 

He left me there for a few seconds not believe what happened, never saying sorry, me crying on the ground and holding my midsection. He hit me so hard that I threw up all the food that I ate for the next 30 minutes straight and he insisted that he did it because he felt threatened and in harms way. Keep in mind we were no using feet or legs in this play fighting.. 

I thought he was my twin flame, now he won't stop drinking no matter what he promises me and I'm so broken. I got a fucking lock and key couples tattoo with him after 6 months because I thought I knew he was the one with all of my heart. I left my previous abusive relationship with a narcissist of 6 years to be with him because he believed in me and gave me freedom and faith in myself and now I'm broken, and alone and he can't accept or even fathom the things I tell him or when I explain how he's made me feel, he just acts as if hes so sorry and he's changing with zero physical results. 

I've never been in a physically abusive relationship before and I'm so scared because I love him so much but I don't think he'll ever EVER be the person I thought he was when we first met.

Our original court documents from the first time together, says I am the domicilliary parent, but we have joint custody. During his time, he has to have his parents involved to keep an eye on him. Well, he wants to fight with me and tell me that I am wrong... I really don't want to fight in court again... all because he won't agree with a schedule that does fit in the best interest of the child.

5900,Could someone help me - was the physical abuse my fault?,"I keep having flashbacks of my boyfriend attacking me... and it's eating away at me. 

He was emotionally abusive for a long time before anything physical happened. And another night when he was drunk (and potentially on drugs, I was also fairly drunk but not as drunk as he was) we got into an argument. *I had just had an abortion literally 2 days before this happened and it was the first time we'd seen each other since. (He also barely spoke to me through out those 2 days and actually ignored me and told me we don't belong together while drunk but said sorry afterwards)* 

The arguement was horrific and he told me I was insane, my family was insane and that I'm disgusting. He was grabbing his belongings to leave me and I told him to just go. I needed him to just get out. But he was grabbing his Alexa?!?! Of all things. He was also only wearing boxers but I pushed him to get out 😩 and I kept doing it I think. This is when he punched me in the face. He did it again and again and then held me by my neck and strangled me. 

Please tell me was it my fault? I think through out my time with him he's triggered me so much because when he's drunk hes broken up with me so many times and just grabbed all his things and left. He also would always ignore me when I'm in a vulnerable state. And considering the abortion and my emotions at the time I just broke. I just needed him to go. 

I hope that makes sense. Please tell me am I in the wrong? I am scared it is my fault. I know I shouldn't have kept pushing him to go 😞",no,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

Since being pregnant we had an argument where I tried to leave his apartment and he started choking me. I almost passed out. He was yelling at me as I tried to fight him off. “What’s wrong with you. You can’t leave! I effing love you. Do you want me to kill you?!”

I haven’t told anyone because I’m honestly in shock. If there was ever a time to not put your hands on me it’s definitely during pregnancy! It’s gotten crazier since then. 
He told me I can’t leave him. When I don’t answer my phone he pops up to my house. He has flat out said he’s obsessed with me since the choking thing and that when I try to leave it makes him feel homicidal. I feel like I’m in a walking nightmare. 
None of the red flags, craziness started until about 3 weeks ago. I was already 3 months pregnant.

I recently had an emergency c section after hemorrhaging and my baby ended up in the NICU. Two days after the c section, he flipped out on me so badly in one of his episodes (threatening me, yelling, throwing things) that security guards rushed in and made him leave and banned him from the hospital. And just the other night, he really put his hands on me for the first time. I am walking on eggshells, and I am scared. He’s unpredictable… when he’s good, he’s great, and when he’s not good, he’s very very scary… 

Idk what I’m looking for in this post, I guess just encouragement that I’m not alone and there’s not anymore I can do.

5910,Wondering how the F I got here,"I've always been a romantic. And very positive. I noticed that started to change as I neared the end of my first relationship. Absorbed, perhaps, his sadness and anxiety. This continued to be chipped away by men I thought loved me. I've had three boyfriends in my life, all long-term and all very different- but the same? Of course I'm the common denominator so there's something wrong in me. I thought maybe with each man I started fresh. I sure didn't actively operate off poor past experiences and expectations. But it always crashed, and hard.

I am pregnant. It's been a dream of my life. Find a man, get married, live in a beautiful house, raise a beautiful family. Loving eachother and the kin healthily and hippily! 

I want to vent the entirety but I also feel it's all so much and weird to tell the world my problems. Not to mention painfully embarrassing...

My baby is due in a month. I have a promise ring on my finger and my boyfriend is still legally married to his first wife with whom he co-parents. I've been pulling teeth for basic needs since the beginning of our relationship. This baby was planned. I'm just asking to make space for the baby. We need a nursery... 
I feel ashamed and hurt. I feel hurt for my family aswell who have been supportive, but I know deep down...

We just had an argument wherein he told me I don't advocate for the needs of his kid. This just because I asked that he arrange the room today with them. He said I have a habit of pushing people out of his life and he won't let me do that to his child...
The people of course he refers to are women he's slept with. Excuse me for being at the very least ""uncomfortable"" with these women with whom he has prioritized over me and sexualized and emotionally devoted himself to at my expense. I'm painted as some monster for crying over his maltreatment. I have played wife and mother when I am neither. As someone who believes in tradition as it's in place for good reason, how the F did I get here?

Now I don't have money to support myself or baby and I feel like such a failure.
I feel so stuck. I'm aware he is awful, and sometimes I think I made my bed. Lie in it. Other times I think I can manifest my way into better, even with him and my situation. Other times I think I don't care how embarrassing or broken it is I'm moving back with my parents and asking for help and keeping him far away. Every path seems hard. 

All I know is I'm tired and sore at 9 months now and this is not the life I pictured for a man to share with me.

5913,I swear I live in the twilight zone,"My Narc boyfriend has asked me to play his favorite game while he does college work. I don't want to but agreed. I told him after my Spanish lesson, I showed him a song in Spanish and wanted to sing it but couldn't exactly identify what they were saying so I kept trying different ways and Narcy Narc starts to laugh and said ""you have no idea how you look right now"" I asked what he meant and said ""the way you sound.. ugh"" he speaks Spanish and is pretty much fluent. I am latina but I don't know Spanish and I am quite sensitive about it because I grew my whole life with people either assuming I speak Spanish and then scold me when I can't then question if I care about my culture or assume I speak Spanish because of my name then laugh at me when I speak Spanish and I have a thick American accent. I don't speak Spanish out loud and he knows this, I only speak in front of him because he told me he would never make fun of me.
That being said once he made fun of how I sound, I moved away to sit somewhere else. 
He questioned why and I said I didn't appreciate making fun of me.
He then got mad at me and said he wasn't. 
I asked him what he meant and he said he couldn't remember.
So I recalled the conversation word for word and he said yea see? I didn't do anything wrong and you just misunderstood like you always do.

I shouldn't have engaged idk why I did but it's so obvious I was almost speechless.

It doesn't matter.
I told him it mattered to me. It's a sensitive subject. He then rolled his eyes and mocked my voice and decided to play copy cat.

When I came home, I said to narc that it went really bad, they found errors in my work and hence I won't be getting bonus this year. There are 2 reasons I did that:

1. I need that bonus money for when I finally leave him;
2. when he is in a bad mood and wants to fight, he just starts. It does not matter if we are at home, if I am at work or working from home, if we are in the gym, store. He will start fighting and won't stop even when I beg him to. There were multiple times when I was working and I literally asked him to wait till when I am done, and we can discuss it then. Of course he wouldn't stop, making it impossible for me to concentrate and work. Basically, I wanted to see if he will maybe see that what he is doing is wrong.

After I told him, he said few nice words, like don't worry, it will be ok, just try to fix the errors and it will be all good at the end. 

The fun part begins here tho. After few minutes, he started apologizing and saying it is his fault that this has happened, he was distracting me etc. Then he just sat there, sighing, saying he feels bad.

5915,Why does it feel like I'm doing something wrong?,"Hi. New here and making my very first post on Reddit! Through a lot of therapy and reflection, I'm starting to realize that my husband may be a narcissist, that this would be out of my control, and our rmarriage may not be salvageable. I've been reading some books that have been extremely helpful, like Dating, Loving and Leaving a Narcissist by Darlene Lancer and How to Stop Caretaking the Borderline/Narcissist by Margalis Fjelstad. So much in these books rings true to my view of our relationship as the enabler/caretaker. 

But I'm having such anxiety about my husband finding out I'm reading these books and thinking he has this issue. I worry he will feel betrayed and hurt, and also worry it would make him angry (he does have issues with anger outbursts). I have kind of danced around the label in discussions/arguments when I try to bring up behaviors I'd like him to change. It just doesn't seem like the label would help anything.  Somehow it feels like reading these books is a betrayal to him and our relationship equivalent to cheating or something of that level.

I want to continue down this path of research/self-discovery, but can't really handle this stress.

Anyway, I've been trying to cut it off with him for a few months now. And this time it's been different. I always had a little love for him still, but he said something that has turned me off to him forever. He told me that he ""has something he wants to tell me, but is scared it'll be the reason I'll want to kill myself. So I can't tell you what it is.""

I've been very disconnected since he told me this. However he tricked me into talking with him today and asked me to just ""hang out and have fun like the old days."" and I said ""I will absolutely not hang out and act like everything is okay when you have this idea about me and you're dangling it over my head."" So I left and he texted me ""So we're never going to talk ever again?"" and I said ""I only want to hear from you if it's the thing you won't tell me.""

TBH, I'm not sure why I'm posting this exactly? I guess it feels like such a turning point for me? I really want to go no contact, but I also really want to know what it is.. Maybe that's why he said it so I always have a reason to keep him friended incase he decides to tell me? I'm not real sure. Also I guess low-key seeking validation that what he said was completely wrong to say? So I don't start back peddling and believing that maybe it wasn't so bad or think about how he isn't saying it to keep me safe. If that was the case, then he wouldn't have said anything to begin with, right?

TL:DR: He said he has something to tell me, but can't tell me because he fears for my safety. Idk if I'll ever know what it is.

5925,A month into a new relationship and you did what ?,"Hey so I’m new here and I’m really glad I found this because I just have to get something off my chest. I was in a 3 year relationship with someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with- we split in March 2019 so it’s been a year and change. We tried to rekindle things in May and spent a few nights at a hotel which I fronted the money for because I so desperately wanted to work it out. He swore up and down he wasn’t seeing anyone seriously and it was just causal hook ups which is fine cause I did the same thing. Well it turns out he had been in a relationship for an entire month with his now current girlfriend and cheated on her with me a month into their relationship. He never did anything like that and didn’t have a single bad bone in his body (aside from financially screwing me to the point where I’m in so much debt but was promised he’d pay it back but never did and blocked me on everything. Thanks for the 2,000 debt buddy) and I’m not mad that we split, I wouldn’t ever want to be back in that relationship again but I do feel disgusting. Like so so disgusting and I cried because I feel horrible that I let him do that to me and to his current gf. Like so sick to my stomach I was nauseous. Anyway I’m in a new relationship now and he is SO great like just the best thing to ever happen to me relationship wise after a string of terrible toxic relationships. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I just found out about it a couple of days ago as a mutual friend told me they’re celebrating their one year. It doesn’t take much to work that math out.

5927,I blocked my date after he helped me with an Uber ride. Was I wrong?,"
I 23f was on my way to see this guy 39m for a first date (we’d been texting a few times for the past week) and the Uber address for the place was wrong (he accidentally told me to go south instead of north ) and so I called him and told him that I was stranded and was just going to get an Uber home and rain check. He said to not do that because he’ll just pay for my Uber to the restaurant and insisted even when I said no.


When I got to the restaurant he yelled at me and told me that he doesn’t have endless money to pay for my Ubers all over town. I offered him money back and tried to leave but it was so uncomfortable that I just stayed.

I ignored him for 2 days and he got mad at me and yelled at me on the phone and called me ungrateful and said that he’s going to be going back to his home state and for me to come visit him and that he’ll pay for my ticket. I said no and said I don’t want anything to do with him and he later made a Facebook post calling me ungrateful and a user.

A lot of the comments agreed with him and it’s really making me question myself.

5929,Boyfriend said I have no opinions,"TL;DR: when my boyfriend was frustrated with my indecisiveness, he said I have no opinions. And it hurt my feelings.


My boyfriend 21M and I, 21F have been been dating for over a year. We literally never fight, and sometimes I struggle getting him to tell me how he actually feels, but overall, we get along well, and I love him very much. 
Whenever we spend time together, my boyfriend always asks what I want do, whether it be something fun or just getting food, and I always hit him with the “I don’t know, I’m OK with whatever”  because I really don’t mind what we do, and I’ve always though of myself as a chill person (plus, if there was something I really wanted to do I’d let him know) 
Last night we were hanging out in his apartment, and as we went into the living room and turned the TV on, he asked what we should do, so I said ,” I don’t know, play Hogwarts legacy maybe… but we can watch something if you want” he seemed annoyed with me, and said “well, do you want to play Hogwarts legacy?” And I said “sounds good with me”. He then said, “well what do you actually want to do?” to which I told him “I’m really OK with whatever” he explained to me that I’m very indecisive most of the time, which he is correct about. I responded by saying that he always asked me what I wanna do, but he never knows what he wants to do either. He then said “ when I ask you what you want, it’s not because I don’t know what I want, it’s because I want you to decide.” He said something along the lines of, “ I have opinions, which are a something you never seem to have.” I can’t exactly describe why, but this really hurt my feelings, and I didn’t say much to him after that . I guess it made me feel like he thought of me as someone who has no thoughts of my own. Since we never fight, 
I wonder if he truly feels that way about me. Eventually I let it go, and we moved on from it,but I’m not sure what to do to help this situation because I’m worried it will create more tension. Does it seem like I overreacted to what he said?

5930,My bf spent the weekend partying with other women and I feel broken,"My (29F)  boyfriend (31M) and I have been together for about a year now. He’s super independent and likes to do his own thing and hang out with his friends a lot, which is totally fine for me, the only time I complain is when we have plans after and he leaves me hanging. 

Well, he had plans to go skiing this weekend with some friends from work about 2.5 hours away from where we live. He’s been telling me for weeks that he was just going to drive there and back the same day (Saturday), and if he got too drunk, then he would get his own place to stay in nearby. 

Buckle up now. His plan conveniently changed on Friday, and he ended up going there a day early, and spending two days in an air bnb with a bunch of people, including some people with their significant other and friends, and a bunch of single girls. I was not invited and I asked him several times why I couldn’t come, and making comments that I wish I could go, but he would never give me a reason why or an invite… Keep in mind that I usually work weekends, but I had this past weekend off for the Easter holiday, even though I don’t celebrate Easter. 

I was very very uncomfortable and upset with the situation, and I didn’t even know until he came home where he was staying, how many people were there, or what mountain they were even skiing at. I told him Saturday morning that I was really sad and upset, and that I was uncomfortable with him partying in an air bnb with a bunch of random girls that idk, but he made a stink about it and got mad saying he knew this would happen and that I always have a problem with him going out with his friends. 

He came home yesterday and immediately wanted to be intimate, and I turned him down because that’s the last thing I wanted after being so upset for 2 days, knowing he was getting drunk and partying with other women. 

I feel like I can’t confront him with my feelings because he always takes it the wrong way, and I’m already in so much pain, I don’t want to cause myself any more. I don’t necessarily think he cheated on me, and I do trust him, but that doesn’t mean I’m happy and comfortable with the situation. 

I just don’t know if this is something that I’ll be able to get past/over. What do y’all think?

TL;DR: 
My boyfriend partied in an air bnb for two nights in another state on a ski trip with a bunch of random women and didn’t invite me, after telling me for weeks if not months that he was going to drive up and back in the same night.

I hate the power that my ex has over me because he genuinely ruined my perception of love, self esteem, and ability to trust. I met someone who is really great (or seems to be) and he’s someone I could see myself with and I’m excited to get to know better. But on the flip side, I’m terrified of dating again and have cold feet already. I’m torn because I want to love again and be happy with a new partner but I’m worried about getting mislead and being naive and starting from square one if my next relationship is bad. I never would have believed that my ex would go on to make my life a living hell for 3 years when I first met him. I go to therapy and journal about this but I’m just genuinely.. scared.

5937,How do you date again after abuse?,"So a little over a year ago I broke up with my abusive ex after posting on this sub made me realize the situation I was in.
I've been in therapy right after the break-up, up until this summer. I've been doing well since the summer and feel like I have finally been able to move on.

I started dating again a few months ago. With the normal ups and downs, but generally it's been good for me to get out there again! 

Now I've met someone who I really vibed with on the first date, so we went out again on a second date last weekend. He's sweet and considerate and funny, but for some reason I just felt this giant wave of panic the day after the second date. I could absolutely not point out to my friend what it was that made me feel this way. She told me it was probably normal after my last relationship, that I would be suspicious of things that are actually normal behaviour, and that I would be overly cautious.

Thinking about it a little more I think it's because he texted me good morning while I was getting ready for work. And that made me think of my ex, how he would get mad if I didn't text him immediately when I woke up. And even though those annoying sudden memories normally don't affect me anymore, this brought back a lot of anxiety.

I honestly wasn’t looking for anything but we wound up meeting at one of our local bars and hit it off. He is EXACTLY the type of person I always pictured myself settling down with after what I went through with my ex husband. I told him pretty early on about the abuse because I knew I still had A LOT of healing to do from what my ex did.

My issue is that because he treats me so well and I don’t have a trauma bond with him like I had with my ex, it almost feels boring. I’m not sure why. I gave so much of myself to my ex husband just hoping one day he would treat me well, and I’m afraid that I will never be able to fully give myself to someone like that ever again.

5947,My ex husband is dating again,"I know this for a couple reasons. One, we still work for the same company (unfortunately, but we also don’t interact at all as we are in different departments) and through the company I became friendly with his new gf who I am fb friends with. She is very nice and has a little boy. 

My ex husband is very very good at pulling the “poor me, I have a horrible life” routine. He suckered me into doing his laundry for him in the first weeks of dating because he said that last time he went to the laundromat he had a seizure, and he was nervous to go there again and have another seizure. 

Our entire marriage was me doing everything while he spent money on action figures and degrading me any time I asked for any sort of help. He was very verbally abusive, refused to even drive himself to work most of the time, and wouldn’t even put gas in his own car. He tried to prevent me from working by unplugging the internet if I wouldn’t cooperate and make what he wanted to eat. It was a miserable existence. 

My family thinks I should warn her what she is getting into, but I think it would do zero good. I don’t think she will listen. Plus, he is in therapy so I don’t know if he will learn to be a decent human to her? I don’t know.

I am so grateful that I educated myself on the characteristics and attitudes of abusive people, because I am certain I dodged a bullet. I didn’t know much about this guy, but he seemed nice and genuine when he asked me to dinner. a huge red flag I noticed throughout the dinner was that he didn’t seem to listen to anything that I said. I had to repeat myself three or four times on certain subjects, and when I really think about it, I know that he heard me. It was just a passive way of disregarding things that he decided were not important. I gave him some benefit of the doubt and kept trying to give the date my best go. But by the end of the dinner, I noticed that his only interest was trying to wear me down on every boundary I had set. My terms were very fair. I said I had to be home at a specific time to relieve my babysitter and take care of my baby. And he played it off like it was just some excuse he could steam roll past because when I said I really needed to get home, he tried to drag me to the mall. I was outraged and said no and wondered how he could think I would prioritize some guy I just met over my own child. Seems like the perfect abusive narcissist to think he was more important than my baby.

""meant to be yours"" gives me panic attacks because he sent me lyrics from it and its so accurate to how i was feeling.) i feel self-centered but i showed my boyfriend pictures of these women and he agreed they look like me, and he knew my ex best friend and said she acted like me as well, but i feel like i might just be overreacting and overthinking what my accusations of abuse actually meant to him.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,yes,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred
5961,Amazing First Date...ended with me crying in my car,"My only relationship I’ve had was with someone who abused me in every way. Drugged me, raped me, kept me locked in our house, wouldn’t let me shower alone, made a key to unlock any door that I shut myself in, and stalked me after he got out of jail. 

I just started dating again and meeting new people. I had an incredible date last night. He made us a picnic- he’s a chef- and we had drinks and talked for hours. He listened about the abuse I’ve gone through and understood that I can’t rush into anything right now.

Afterwards, he walked me to my car and asked if he could kiss me. I appreciated the hell out of him asking, but I made a rule with myself to never kiss on the first date. So, I said not this time. He was completely okay with it and we hugged. 

However, I felt the tears in my eyes when I said no. I got in my car and tried every tactic to not have a panic attack. I called a friend and she helped me figure out why I was so upset. 

I was trained by my ex to expect pain when I said no to him. It was fear that caused me to be so upset. When does this pain go away? I just want to be happy and enjoy meeting new people.

Update: He turned out to be a jerk. Long story short, I told him what I wanted in a relationship (which included someone who didn’t smoke) and he told me that I was irrational, shallow, and small-minded because he didn’t fit what I wanted.

5967,Dating after abuse - 90 days no kissing,"So, I’m not even out yet, so dating isn’t even on my mind at all, this is more of an opinion question. 

Lately I’ve been seeing all this advice to avoid physical contact for a few months when you start dating someone so you can get to know them and sus out red flags or whatever. I get that, at the same time I don’t know…

My husband and I were friends, close friends, hang out every day and sleep over friends, before we started dating. For almost a year. I was even still kind of dating my ex. 

I knew that my husband liked me and would get jealous but really no red flags (a few looking back, but some that wouldn’t have been catchable and some I just didn’t know better - I was 23). 

So by the time we were dating and got physical he knew more about me than anyone, including my ex-fiancé. He had ALL the info and then some. 

I’m not saying jump everyone you date, at the same time…building a purely emotional bond with someone? Isn’t that the perfect love bomb for most women? 

If I’m ever out, if I’m ever dating again, I probably would go by this rule because yes, it does get rid of the ones who are going to try to marry you on date 2 and the ones who are just a one off. At the same time, if there is chemistry, 90 days building just emotional intimacy and sexual tension seems like a pretty effective way to have a good, solid, efficient trauma bond very quickly.

Am I just overthinking this?

He got very emotionally abusive as the relationship went on, and once I got some distance from the relationship I realized he was also very sexually abusive (very coercive). It's been about 2 years since we broke up, and about 1 year since all contact was cut off with him to stop his stalking and harassment. He was my first relationship, and now that I'm sort of trying to move past it, I feel like I'm stuck.  I haven't gone on any dates since, and honestly, I've never really gone on a proper date.  I've been seeing a therapist, and it's been very helpful opening up about what happened since I sort of pushed everything down and didn't talk about it for a long time. I don't really mind being single, but I also feel like at some point I'd like another relationship. I'm just very scared to put myself back out there. I've gotten asked out a few times recently but I haven't really acted on them.  As previously stated, I don't really know how dating works, my first relationship (the abusive one) was really just a friendship that turned into a relationship, so there was never really any ""first date, second date"" sort of thing. Considering that I still get a sinking feeling in my stomach any time someone flirts with me or asks me to go to coffee / dinner, I feel like I'm not ready. But I also feel like if I don't at least try to go on a date then I'll never be ready. It's also been hard to differentiate whether I'm just not interested in someone or if I'm too scared and my brain is making me think I'm not interested. Also, because I don't really know how dating works, is it rude to go out with someone if you're not really interested in something long term? It'd be nice to ""practice"" dating, but the idea that the other person may be expecting a more serious relationship outcome is what makes me really scared, because I don't think I'm there yet (and because I'm a people pleaser, I don't know if I'd be able to turn down going on another date if I'm not really interested).   


TLDR: Been out of an abusive relationship for awhile, feeling very scared at the idea of going on a date / trying to start another relationship.

But recently, my close friend expressed interest in me and I think under normal circumstances I would like him (I'm definitely physically attracted to him, we have a ton in common, I trust him a lot, etc). But once I noticed he was interested in me, I became super anxious around him and feel like I lost all feelings. I'm just so scared I'll never feel romantic or sexual attraction again, or miss out on a potentially great relationship because my feelings are all out of wack.

I said nothing. No real abuse was said...although he did take my written notice and stick it down his pants and wipe his butt with it. It was his copy. I left.

5982,Can’t tell if my online date is another abuser,"Hey there, everyone. Just like the title says. I have a lot of anxiety because I’m really young (21) and have only had abusive relationships in my life. (Family and partners.)

So I would really appreciate some help being able to tell if this person sounds safe or not, since I have a hard time telling myself and I don’t want to get hurt again.

We’ve both sent multiple selfies to each other (he even sent me a photo of him as a baby), he decided to tell me his real name, we have a LOT in common. I pretty much know he’s not catfishing or scamming. He even gave out his phone number first (we’re talking on a dating app) and said it’s there whenever I’m comfortable and hasn’t asked me about it since.

But, he’s just SO NICE! A real sweet talker. But not perverted. He started talking about massages and he didn’t make it sexual at all!? Even I wanted to make it go that route 😅 I asked him why he didn’t and he said he wanted to get to know me better. And he hates how men can be so comfortable with making women uncomfortable.

I just…what!?

I’ve never met someone like him before. I’m really afraid of it all being lies. I think I’m scared because he calls me “love” which makes me really happy. I’m just afraid of being naive and acting like a stupid teenager.

Does this sound legit to anyone? We’ve been chatting for a few days now and I haven’t found a single flaw, which is suspicious to me…

I feel like I’m being silly, but I’m also terrified of being naive and hurt again. I think we’re all afraid of starting a new relationship. I’m not in any rush to get into another one. But I just don’t want to waste my time on someone who may seem too good to be true.

After my previous relationships, the concept of a healthy relationship sounds like a fairy tale to me. So I have almost no sense of what is actually real or not.
My previous abusers told me how much they loved me and were proud of me, but would backhand it later.

My ex was particularly critical about my weight gain, making comments like “is this the version of you I deserve?” and “don’t you care I’m not attracted to you?” Everyone in my life, my therapist included, is encouraging me to date. They think it will help me move forward from the trauma, learn that other men can be kinder, feel less lonely, less worried about being steps behind my friends, and get some positive reinforcement from other people liking me.

Hi everyone! I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for 6 years. My ex was super “alpha”, he was manipulative and controlling. I spent a lot of time terrified to get into another abusive relationship. We have been broken up for a little over a year and I have done a lot of healing, and finally feeling ready to date again, and decided to download some dating apps. I went out on a few dates that went well but I didn’t feel it. I met guy that I REALLY liked. We hit it off really well. Between our first and second date we texted a lot and even started sending voice notes. Now we have been on many dates, and he even met some of my friends who thought he was great, and we talk consistently. He is very very into me, which is flattering, but kind of scares me also. He is very nice, always taking me out for nice dinners, he woke up early and made me a nice breakfast the first time I slept over, but his extreme kindness worries me. He is extremely attentive always asking me questions about my friends and family, he loves listening and complimenting me. It makes me feel like I’m getting buttered up to be manipulated again. I don’t know if my past trauma is sending me into panic mode, or if my gut is trying to tell me something. He seems very genuine, but I am also so scared. Is his intense interest in me a red flag or is my past trauma making me scared? Any advice ?

In your experience, do you think abusers change with new partners? What do you think he's telling these girls? He lied to me about cheating, he gave me an STI, and continued to cheat when I gave him a second chance. I'm just wondering if you think he'll continue this pattern in his future relationships?

I had all the red flags from the beginning (indeed, I didn’t know they were straight up abusive, just thought it was an odd behaviour) yet for some unknown reason (will probably find out in therapy why) and because we moved in together during the pandemic, I stayed in the relationship.

However, I also took notice of red flags during the whole time, so I was completely aware of both his behaviour and of me changing because of him. I guess that somehow that grew my inner frustrations because I couldn’t solve it, or him. As for the change itself, I changed from extroverted to introverted and having less acquiantances (which gives me energy) due to his jealousy, and I became more attentive to his needs than mine.

I’m wondering this, because I feel a bit stupid now that I did recognize all the red flags and how they made me feel, yet I stayed and ended up loving the guy, which makes it now, 2 years later, more difficult for the both of us. And for the cats.

My case was also brought to a specialist at the Superior Court so that they can weigh in on what a plea should look like, given my ex’s record and associations.

6030,Tomorrow is my court date for the restraining order,"Tomorrow is my court date for the restraining order.  8 wish the police on scene had filed an emergency protective order but he didn't and I didn't know to ask. So my husband has been here everyday going back and forth between being horrible and being horribly depressed.  Lots of yelling then lots of crying.  

He keeps asking me to not follow through with the restraining order since he thinks it will lead to a harsher sentence for his domestic violence felony charge.  I do not want him to have a harsher sentence.  I never wanted him to be arrested.  He's still angry that I called 911 when he broke my car window and glad shards were stuck in my face.  If I hadn't have called,  the neighbors would have.  

The reason I want to the restraining order is because I'm scared of him.  Even if he isn't violent again,  he can't help himself from yelling at me and saying horrible things about me to our kid. We need a break.  He says if I cancel the order,  he promises to take a break but he needs to know that we're going to stay together. I can't make that decision right now.  He hasn't communicated anything to me that even sounds like a glimpse of promising change. He has needed help for years and has seriously needed help for the last 8 months but refuses to admit that he needs help.  I need help too. I recently began therapy.  I've only had 2 sessions so far. It hasn't helped much yet. 

He says if I don't know right now that I just need a break and that we'll end up staying together that we should just file for divorce now. I told him that if he can't h give me time to think and know that he's getting help then we should just file for divorce.  

By this time tomorrow I'll be standing before the judge. I've been strong. A few times in the past few days I've almost succumbed to weakness but have remained strong.

It's been years since I was told that. I remember trying to protect what I thought was a family and loosing every single person along the way, including myself. 

I ask myself every single day ""why him?""

To the girl that is dating my abuser, I remember not being strong enough to speak up. I remember thinking I couldn't and would never get away from him. I remember staying stiff. He is now your abuser but I want to tell you one thing. If there is anything I regret in the entire world it's staying silent in the mouth of violence.

He sent me another message today saying how hurt and confused he is and wanting to know what happened, which I can totally empathize with, even if my head tells me that he doesn't deserve it.

When I became aware of this “red flag”, I bluntly told him that I felt that he wasn’t enthusiastic about dating me and that it would be better for us to go separate ways. 

After I suggested this, he started showering me with his charm and compliments again and even suddenly wanted to take me out to a nice restaurant that I had told him about. 
He texted me all these things at once and I remember taking my time to respond because in the meantime my best friend had told me that he sounds like a classical abuser. While I was torn between listening to my best friend and my gut feeling and agreeing to his plans, he texted me one message after the other. 

When I finally agreed to meet up with him, everything was “good and romantic again”. He took pictures of me at the dinner and put these on his Instagram. when we went to his place afterwards, he played my favorite love symphonies on the piano.

Afterwards, he stroked my hair and told me that he was so sad that I “misunderstood” him, that he was so sad that he gave me a wrong impression. He told me it was important for him that I knew that he absolutely loved dating me.

When the relationship came to a bitter end, I realized that he truly never had feelings for me in the first place. So my intuition was right. 

But why didn’t he just accept my suggestion that we should go separate ways if he was so cold towards me from the beginning? Why did he try so hard to convince me that my intuition was wrong?

Anyway, he decided that I was grounded for a few weeks to make up for the bad days we had.
I had to delete Facebook, for example, because he thinks I spend too much time on it. I also have to ask him for permission about literally everything. And my kids have to ask him for everything too (he is the stepdad, he used to let me decide punishments and permissions, but not anymore), and finally, I am not allowed to go out with friends or by myself, only with him or my kids. However, I am not allowed to even mention going to museums, events, restaurants or anything like that, much less go to those. We only go out to run errands or whenever he feels like going to the movies or eating outside.

I wish I could at least go to the mall or to get coffee with a friend, but that is absolutely forbidden. (This one rule has been going on even since before my meltdowns). 
And also, he says he likes being the boss, and that I should like my new life of obedience.
He has mentioned that this will last longer than a few weeks, probably forever, because he is giving us ""everything"" (food and shelter, because he doesn't give me money, and doesn't let me work either) and the least we can do is obey him.

So... Is this abvse in some way, or is this normal? Some friends tell me that this is a kind of violence, that is why I am asking here in this sub.

6060,Submitted a Clare's Law request against the guy I'm seeing. Got a disclosure yesterday,"About three months ago I (23) met this guy (21). The day I met him he told me he had an electronic tag and was in prison until a few months ago due to drug charges. No judgment please, I continued seeing him as I thought lots of people our age do take drugs and he said he was caught with enough cocaine that he was arrested and charged with intent to supply. We got intimate quickly and after a few weeks we went on another date and he told me he lied about why he went to prison.

He told me he went to prison for actual bodily harm he committed on the mother of his child. I was completely shocked as I did not think he was this kind of person. He told me a very detailed account and the short of it was himself and his baby mama planned a date night to try and relight the spark in their relationship. They both got drunk and she tried to leave the hotel and was shouting and he put his hand over her mouth in a panic and tried to get her back into the room. He said during this their legs got tangled and she fell onto her face which caused injuries and he was arrested. He appeared remorseful when telling me this.

Despite my better judgment I continued seeing him and we had a normal progression in our relationship. I felt very safe with him and he spent 4 nights a week at my apartment. I submitted a Clare's Law request for peace of mind and yesterday the disclosure came back.

The police officer called me yesterday. Regarding the incident above, she said when hotel security arrived they observed him on top of her strangling her and hitting her in the face. She was unconscious. The charge was originally attempted murder and was reduced. He has an unlimited restraining order. He has been investigated for harassment and/or violence against two other ex-partners. He has also been arrested for assault on his mother and stepfather on separate occasions. He has also been arrested for possession of a bladed weapon.

I am devastated and feel like an absolute fool. Luckily I have just moved to another city several hours away for university. I need to end the relationship and need advice on how to do so. I have contacted a DV helpline and they have made me an appointment to discuss a risk assessment and a safety plan. I feel awful because I cannot comprehend that he is this awful person. How do I get over this?

TLDR: Clare's Law request was made against my partner. The disclosure revealed a long history of violence and harassment and I am devastated.",no,no,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
6062,My partner got arrested on Friday and his bail conditions prevents him from contacting me until his court date and I am struggling,"I have finally accepted I have been in an emotionally abusive relationship. My partner had a terrible anger always causing massive arguments that I never understood why. He would always put me down and made me doubt myself all the time. We have been together over 2 years and lived together and shared a dog together. 

On Friday night we were out for a few drinks and when we were leaving the air hit me and I had to sit down as I was feeling lightheaded and dizzy but my partner was basically dragging me and screaming/shouting at me. 
A few people came over to me to help me and basically telling my partner his behaviour isn’t right etc. This older couple were filming him because of how he was acting and offered to take me home which I accepted, we walked to their flat (partner got taxi home himself) which was just around the corner and brought out their policeman neighbour asking for advice because they didn’t feel I would be safe at mine and my partners flat. But I said I thought I would be okay so they drove me and when I got into the flat it was unbearable and decided that I couldn’t stay there a minute longer and couldn’t put up with what I have been enduring for some time. 

When I left I phoned my mum to pick me up and while I was waiting for her, my partner went out for a walk with our dog and I phoned my friends as
I was hysterically crying. 

When my mum came shortly after so did the police who came up to the car saying the couple who took me home had phoned them and I had to make a statement because they were arresting him because of members of the public phoning them and had video evidence. I haven’t been in contact with him since his release but the police from domestic abuse phoned me and told me his bail conditions are not to phone or contact me nor am I allowed to go to the flat and he’s not allowed to come to my parents house. He’s due in court end of November and in am really struggling I can’t sleep I’m upset this is someone I’ve spend everyday with for 2 years and I love him and I never wanted him to get arrested just wanted him to realise he really needs help! I had been trying to get him help for a while. 

I feel like I don’t want to be constantly annoying my friends and family with how much I am hurting. I know it’s the right thing to be out that relationship and I think this has been a blessing in disguise but I really am struggling to cope.

6065,How do I deal with this?,"I have been in and out of abusive situations for years. I seem to attract a certain kind of man. Even the good ones were the sort I had to beg for the bare minimum. 

Since October I’ve been in my first healthy relationship. He is truly wonderful, he’s kind, wonderful, patient and understanding. I have never felt pressured to do anything or be anything other than myself. And he genuinely just takes things in his stride and deals with me on my good and bad days. I joke that he’s the last man I’ll date, but it’s not really a joke anymore because I can acknowledge we haven’t been dating for ages but I feel like I’ve met my soul mate. 

However, I don’t know if this is a trauma response or what, I find myself agreeing to things I don’t want, implicitly or explicitly. Everything from where we eat right up to stuff during sex. I don’t know how to stop this or talk to him about it. I don’t even know if I want to. The one time he has ever got really upset with me was when I admitted we had sex and I didn’t want to.

Once we had our son we had one physical altercation and I told him I wouldn’t do this cycle anymore. He stopped and I stopped and we grew a lot and has a strong relationship without abuse, communicated better, got a house and grew as a family .

6074,Narcissist ex blocking communication with our young child - has anyone else dealt with this?,"My covert narcissist ex-husband is refusing to allow me to have nightly phone/video calls with our five-year-old on the nights she's with him. I like talking to her every evening so that I can get a glimpse into her day and wish her good night. When I have been able to talk to her, we're never on the phone more than two to three minutes, and I'm always the one to end the conversation. My ex has never asked to speak to our child when she's with me.

We currently have 50/50 custody with a 2-2-5-5 schedule, and our agreement states that both of us can speak with our child at any time when she's with the other parent. My understanding, however, is that as long as I'm able to talk to her every once in a while, no judge will find my ex to be in contempt of the agreement.

I'm just sort of at loose ends. Attempting to talk to him about the phone call issue goes nowhere. He is adamant that I'm crazy for wanting to talk to her every evening and that it's not good for her. He told me that she needs to learn that because her parents are divorced, we are no longer a family and she cannot see or speak to both of us every day. I have gone ""gray rock"" with my ex, and I get the sense that he is trying to do the same with me. My ex moved on very quickly - he began dating a coworker a couple of weeks after I moved out, and she and her child have now moved in with him from another state. They have been together for six months. 

It's just an incredibly strange situation, and I'm wondering if the new girlfriend has encouraged him to parallel parent. He has told me that he no longer has any interest in co-parenting with me, which was what we agreed on as we were going through the amicable/collaborative divorce process. I deeply regret the decision to use the collaborative process - it was an attempt to save money, but my ex simply lied and deceived me and the attorneys through the entire process and showed his true colors once the judge had issued the final decree.

6075,Needing Ideas! PLEASE!,"Tomorrow is the day I have been dreading since I left, move out day. I left my abusive husband and retreated to another city with family for almost 3 months. I am now back in town and have set myself up with an apartment which means I have to go get my things. About an month ago, we came to an agreement regarding possessions. He's been refusing to sign papers though because I am currently in posession of his vehicle, however,  I have made it very clear that if he gives me the notarized and signed papers we could trade cars at the same time. He is still refusing. 

I have emailed him a date and time to meet me with hopefully signed papers. I also let him know I would be moving my things out of our house at that time as well. I agreed with ""his idea"" ;-) to have as little contact as possible recently and asked him to leave while I move my things out...radio silence. I know he knows what I'm going to do because he went and got a haircut. Sounds weird, but I know he did it because he knows he'll see me. 

I am going to a public place to trade cars. I figured I would wait about 10 minutes and if he doesn't show, I will go to the house with my mom and see if my key still works. 

If he does show up to trade cars and 🤞 have notarized and signed paperwork, I have my brother and dad waiting by the house to check the locks to make sure we can get in when he leaves. They will not be going in. Just making sure the door can be unlocked. They will text me to let me know.

So here is where I get worried. How do I manage to stay in the car to exchange keys while I wait for my dad and brother's text without looking suspicious?

6076,My kid is scared and angry about ex’s lack of social distancing.,"Last weekend was the first since early March that my kids left our house and went to stay over at their dad’s. His house is a wreck that he is slowly renovating. He is constantly doing loud construction work there, and workers are there off and on (not when the kids are there). The kids stay in the non-construction site sections of the house.

My daughter (12) is upset bc he is going out to stores constantly, leaving the kids in the house, which she’s not even comfortable with. He talks to the kids about dates with assorted ppl and inviting girlfriends over. By contrast, the kids and I had been at home since this started, having everything delivered, trying to stay as safe as possible.

This is so hard for her. I know I have to facilitate custody. I know I have zero control over his actions. But getting my daughter to accept this and get over her fear and anger enough to get in the car and go, is very difficult.

6079,Why did I engage?,"So I’ve been talking with my therapist about how I’ve wanted to ask why he’s thrown me under the bus (smear campaign) to our entire friends and family for his behavior. So last night, when he was picking up our pet he asked me if I was okay (I’ve been going grey rock with one word answers).  I told him that’s it’s damn difficult to be nice to someone who had bad talked me and lied to everyone we know when he knows what really happened. He just stood there with his mouth open. At first, he looked confused but then I realized that he didn’t have an answer but was probably surprised that I was saying anything. I said that I didn’t need an answer because I know him. I knew that he needed to look good in front of everybody. I asked him why we were getting a divorce when all I wanted to do was talk. (See my historical posts for context).  He stood there silent and said maybe we shouldn’t share the pet anymore if I was going to talk to him like this. 

He left and now I don’t know what to feel. It’s been three months since he moved out. I’m positive that he already has a gf as he was already on a dating website before he moved (while simultaneously asking to be with me).  Any support or advice is welcome. Bah.

No end in sight. He doesn’t agree on the price of our house, and I’ve been waiting for over 3 weeks for him to tell us what appraiser he wants to use. I finally just emailed some myself to get it to move along. 

He’s already dating. My friends have seen him out. It’s disgusting. He’s a liar. He has time to date but not do anything about the divorce HE WANTED. Makes me sick that technically I’m paying for half this stupid (or poor) girls meal. He’s an emotional predator and not a safe person, totally selfish and gross. He triangulated me, gaslit, raged, the whole shebang. 

Any advice for how to move things along? My lawyer is good, but I don’t know what to tell her. She helped me get him to get his stuff out finally at the beginning of December. So his stuff is finally gone after almost a year! He has time for what he wants to do but not the stuff he’s too busy for (like getting divorced or figuring out what to do with a piano). Oh, also when he left he took 1 cup, 1 bowl, 1 plate, etc and then complained to me about his apt feeling lonely and wanted to know where he could get a rug. I was like are you kidding me? He’s 5.

6082,Did your ex ever accept the separation/divorce?,"I've been separated for a number of months now. I can't yet file because of a few reasons I can't go into. He is able to file if he wants to, but chooses not to. In fact, he appears to still have hope that we will reconcile. He has said this to me on multiple occasions, even though he has tried online dating in what appears to be an attempt to set up new supply just in case I actually do leave.  For the record I am not dating and probably won't be able to for a very long time. 

I've been sleeping separately from him from the day I said I wanted to separate almost 8 months ago. Im about 95% gray rock at this point. I don't talk to him about anything other than the house and kids. I have said on multiple occasions that I want to physically separate and likely won't change my mind about divorce. 

I'm assuming he won't ever accept it, even if he's seeing other people in the meantime. He keeps inviting me to things with his family and tries to guilt trip me about it because our kids are little and it's safer for them if I go along. 

While there are a handful of reasons why I can't yet file, one of the biggest ones is that I'm waiting to feel strong enough to leave without getting emotionally weak as a result of his denial/manipulations and his family's disdain for me in making this choice.",yes,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

6092,How to move on?,"Hi, this is going to be a little long as I have no other outlet for venting right now. 
I (20F) just got out of a two year relationship with my abusive ex (34M). 

Our relationship was very toxic from the start. He was constantly sexting other women and flirting with them, causing me to be super jealous and worried. 
The first time he blew up on me was when I went through his phone and found messages of him still texting his ex that he loved her and wanted to be together. I woke him up and confronted him and he began screaming and threw my phone at me so hard that it left a large mark on my forearm. 
We have had many fights, and 10+ of them have involved him getting physical or even threatening my life on a few occasions. 
The last straw was a few days ago when he had been drinking for three days straight and went off on me again when I was literally just curled up in a ball trying to ignore him. He prevented me from leaving initially but I was able to sprint out the door when he went to the kitchen. I called the police and then went to court to file a restraining order as well as a move out order. He left and is doing god knows what. I asked my landlord to change my locks and hopefully he’ll be coming in a few hours to do so.
I moved across the country from my family when I was 17 and I have no friends or family in the state that I currently reside except a few old coworkers that I was never close with. My ex and I spent literally all of our time together. How do I move on from this? I haven’t spoken to my therapist in a few weeks and will be reaching out to them today. I feel so broken. Part of me still wishes that things will work out between us but I am standing firm on my decision to not get back together. Another part of me wants to immediately start dating or meeting up with people but I feel that I should allow myself to heal before that happens. Can anybody offer any advice?

6108,No contact/is change possible??,"So me and my abusive ex broke up. We’re in our early 20s. We had a big fight last month, I called the cops and he went to jail. We broke the restraining order and started hanging out again. It happened again, so I asked for three days no contact. He signed my number up for a bunch of spam calls and constantly called me on different text now numbers, so I changed my number. He hacked into my Twitter and unblocked himself and I just didn’t block him again bc he would’ve kept emailing me if he couldn’t text me on Twitter. He was texting me pretty often during no contact but I didn’t respond. He was saying he is taking therapy seriously now, booked an appointment with a psychiatrist to try and get anger medicine, and sent me a link for couples therapy. So I started to consider going back. 

Well. I got an Instagram message from an old friend who was dating one of my abusive exs female aquaintences, it was screen shots of my ex texting his girlfriend asking to hook up. She declined saying her and her ex just broke up and she wasn’t ready to have sex with anyone yet. He said “no one gotta know but us”. So obviously I’m pissed. I sent him the screen shots and he started begging saying he was drunk and does not want her. He thought I was moving on so he was trying to distract himself. Whatever.

So, he constantly blew up my Twitter and email, and I ended up flipping out and arguing with him back and forth yesterday and the day before bc it really hurt me. I wasn’t out here trying to sleep with anyone. I was trying to clear my head.

So, after all the arguing, we ended up hanging out and it was normal. We have couples therapy Friday. Is all the therapy and stuff going to work, or am I wasting my time? I just don’t know.

6109,I (25F) started dating this girl (25F) but I don’t feel any butterflies or euphoria around her. Does this mean I don’t have romantic feelings?,"I (25F) started dating this girl (25F) recently and we have so much in common. We are so compatible and could make great life partners. We have amazing sex and I enjoy every second of our time together. 

But there’s a few issues- I do not feel butterflies or euphoria when I’m around her.

For context I have never been in a committed relationship before. In the past I have only pursued emotionally unavailable people who make me feel “high” and “addicted” to them.
The girl I’m seeing now has been consistent and communicative from the start and I definitely feel a sense of trust, safety and security around her, but I don’t feel any rush or massive waves of excitement or dopamine. My heart doesn’t flutter at all around her even when she tells me she likes me. I like her company a lot but I’m having a hard time deciphering if I have romantic feelings for her. 

It’s only been one week since we started talking and we’ve hung out and had sex every day of the week and had a couple romantic dates. 

I feel comfortable, content, and happy around her. But I don’t feel any excitement or butterflies. I’m worried that at this age I don’t know what love is, and I have a desire to seek out inconsistent partners. I am on anti-depressants and have been thought by my psychiatrist to have adhd. 
And if I’m being completely honest I think if this girl was less consistent and emotionally unavailable, I would be completely obsessed with her. 

I want to have deep passionate feelings for this girl but so far I don’t feel much more intensity than if we were just friends. Could this be a good thing? Is this all new to me? If I enjoy her company and her companionship should I just focus on that for now? I don’t want to lose this perfect girl nor do I want to break her heart but this is all so new to me.

6111,Idk what to do - caught baby daddy bf texting ex “hey babe”,"My bf/ baby daddy (32M) and I (31F) have been together for 2.5 years and have an 8mo baby. We got pregnant after a year and a month of dating. I always thought it seemed fast but we were serious from our first date. The pregnancy was an accident and we ultimately decided to keep the baby with the agreement that we would be together but not rush to get married just because we’re having a baby. It’s been a long hard year but we had been working thru things and I felt like we were in a really good place. Not perfect but doing good. Apparently not.

Fast forward to today. I find him texting his ex. The thread was new from today and her notifications were silenced. So he knew exactly what he was doing. First text was from him “hey babe” and then him asking her to see him today before he had work this evening.  He says nothing has happened and they haven’t met up yet. I don’t think I believe him.

I don’t know what to do. If we didn’t have the baby together, I’d be gone. How can I ever trust him again? What will this do to our child either way….

We live in a very expensive area, and can’t necessarily pay the rent and all the bills myself. Plus I’m getting laid off in 5 weeks from today. My son loves his dad so much.

6113,"I'm over the man, but the infidelity still feels personal","It's been just over a year since the cheating happened, and I sort of turned a page today. I am over the man, but I am not over the disrespect or the ordeal. I was with my ex for 3 years, and left him over a series of ""small"" infidelities. A few months later, he returned sobbing, sorry and inundating me with favours and attention. Shortly after we starting getting intimate, I discovered that he was in a relationship and told his partner. She said she ""felt sorry for me"". I never spoke to him or her again, and ended up leaving the country a few months later.

I was shown something today that I wish I had not seen (I didn't go looking and didn't ask-- that is always the first comment), and I am kind of surprised by how I feel. He might be a cheater, but he isn't ashamed of himself or his partner. When we were together, my ex made it clear that I was an embarrassment to him. He questioned my integrity, my appearance, my living space (I took what I could afford). He insisted that my awkwardness was the result of a learning disability (in hindsight, it was the result of his abusiveness). I was made to feel low class, and bad for not ""getting it"" and simply being better. I spent every day trying to be better for him. What I saw today implies that he has pride in his partner, and that he's really opened his life up, if anything. I realise that he's still a cheater, and I don't really care to ponder who he is behind closed doors. All I know is that he was ashamed of me, involved me in a shameful situation without my consent, and is now sharing his pride for his new partner openly. 

I never knew to be ashamed of myself until I met that man, but this experience has opened my eyes and made me wonder if OTHER bad experiences came down to the same set of judgements. I am incredibly burnt out on the idea of ""glowing up"". I've used the past year to move and begin a career change, but I've kept my life quiet and I'm still single. I'm now incredibly alert to disrespect when dating and, when it happens, I wonder if its because other people are seeing what he saw.

6126,My healing kept me safe.,"Sorry this is long…

I’m on a dating site and have been on a few dates.  Yesterday I met with a man who I communicated with a few times.  He was very talkative and intelligent, but I thought he may be a little self-involved.  I figured I’d meet him anyway and see how things would go.  He talked my ear off for about an hour.  After that, we decided to leave the coffee shop and go for a walk around the town.  

As we’re walking, he mentioned that he quit school when he was younger.  When I asked him if he was of the age (we are Gen X) where you could just sign yourself out at 16, he got all weird. He said he “didn’t know.” When I asked him how old he was, he said he “didn’t know.”  When I asked him if he knew what year he was born, he told me.  At that point, I did the math in my head.  He was 5 years older than he originally said he was.  When I used the date he gave me to try to figure out the year he could’ve quit school, he started saying, “there’s no way you could know, maybe I stayed back or maybe I started school late.”  Either way, the conversation was giving off weird vibes.  

I suggested we go back to the coffee shop.  As soon as we get there, he says, “let’s go for a ride.”  Calling his bluff, I said, “ok, I’ll drive.”  He insisted on driving.  I told him that I was not comfortable getting in his car because I barely knew him.  He kept insisting on driving.  I said, “if you’re going to insist on driving, I guess this is where we part ways.”  He said, “ok.”  We shook hands and we left.  

Could I have been overthinking this whole thing and making assumptions?  Maybe?  But, as I was driving home, I got the feeling that I somehow dodged a bullet.  

In the past, I would’ve been so worried that I offended him with my questions, the fact that his answers were possible red flags would’ve gone over my head.  Or, I would’ve had that weird, gut feeling but ignored it.  I would’ve likely gotten in the car with him to make up for asking him questions that were making him uncomfortable (and ignored my own uncomfortable feelings).  In the past, I know that I would not have said no, without guilt and in such as decisive manner.  

Although the situation was a off-putting, the fact that I took care of myself and felt no guilt or shame, felt amazing.

6128,Almost 20 years of dating...,"I finally realized that when someone isn't lovebombing me, it's a good thing 😆

I always wanted a guy to immediately fall in love with me when I was younger, and when they did, I thought that was romance but they were the most unhealthiest and selfish interactions I've had with men.

I feel a lot of this is due to conditioning. Watching movies and shows that portray love, or fast love, isn't realistic at all. I also dealt with years of teasing and rejection growing up, so when I was being lovebombed, it made me feel more confident and assured that a guy really wanted me.

It's taken way too long for me to realize this. I hope some of you read this and recognize that lovebombing is a sign to stay away. I still need therapy to recognize how to navigate and move slowly in a healthy relationship. I'm interested in someone right now and already I'm craving what I've been used to in abusive relationships... the obsession and constant attention.

Instead, I'm trying to focus on myself and when we do interact, pick up any red flags, and ask questions here and there about their goals and motivations in life.

6136,I  need support after a bad relationship with a narcissist who was delusional/possible schizophrenia,"I moved in with a guy who seemed sweet and caring. Then it got abusive quickly. It was narcissistic abuse (constant gaslighting, criticism, walking on egg shells as I had do do everything he wanted just how he wanted it, bad sarcasm that was not funny, etc). mixed in with bad mental health. It was like I dated 2 different guys. One before I moved in and a different one after. I think he had schizophrenia too because he was preparing for an alien invasion ( doomsday prepper) and watching alien youtbe videos. He told me that ""he knows the truth and that the aliens are us from the future. They are coming back in time. They want to harvest our organs. "" he was convinced of it too because ""He knows the truth.""

He would lock himself in his room. He would mumble weird things to himself. His cat pissed everywhere too. He would get extremely verablly abusive and just yell and scream for not much of a reason. I wonder if he hallucinate things and then yelled at me? Idk?

I feel sad I wasted so much time with him. I have moved out and gotten away from him. It was an aweful breakup too. He kept yelling at me not to take his stuff all while I packed up and moved out. I am not like that at all. He didn't even know me. 

He would tell me my job was why I acted the way I acted that i was immature because i
I worked with children.I couldn't handle anything. That I would pick fights for no reason. He threw the fact that I was older in my face (even though he was in his mid forties) and basically said I was to old to find someone and would never recover from the break up and that I would miss him.  I am so happy he is gone. I felt like he was describing himself. 

It was a hollow connection. There was no close emotional connection even when things were going well in the beginning.

But words hurt. It hurts. And the man's whole life, from his mental health to his inability to connect with people, to his house demonsished by his cats as it was like living in a giant litter box all makes me cringe with discust while I feel I got ptsd from it all.
I don't know how to process the relationship. I feel dumb for letting myself get into such a situation. People keep telling me that you cannot predict someone else's actions.

I feel sad that it all happened. For a moment, I believed I had found someone. For just a brief moment I had been happy and then it was gone.

6139,What does a healthy relationship even look like?,"After being with my abuser for 8 years, I'm in a new relationship with a man I feel is so good. To the core. He proves it all the time, following through when he says he'll do something, communicating, helping with literally zero complaints. Our emotional connection is wild. He never backs down when I get emotional, is always trying to find ways to support me without hindering me (like doing my dishes in the morning when I'm at work and not in the kitchen). 

Even a few months in now, I feel like I'm waiting for something awful to happen. Like this part is the love bombing and he's about to explode. I know that it's me and my past that is making me think that way. He isn't my abuser. He's open about how he feels, he makes me laugh so much. He's introduced me to his hobbies and never gets upset when I'm not into whatever he's showing me. And vice versa. 

I was denied the opportunity to find new hobbies or even cut my hair how I wanted. So I've been on this journey of discovering myself and making choices for just me and he's on board. I cut my hair to have bangs (ngl they actually look fantastic and I fucking love them) and his look of joy when he saw me was just *chefs kiss*. And I found that I really like building Lego sets. He joined me for a few. I started gaming when I have time and he'll play on his computer while I do.

I just don't know. I'm already in therapy and have been since before I met him. Is this what healthy relationships look like? Just enjoying the company and supporting each other? From doing laundry to going on a date, I swear this man never waivers in how he treats me and talks to me.

We were together 12 years I ended up in a mental health facility. 
It's not that black and white and I feel I always need to give all the details to people.

Anyway, fast forward 3 month and a half and she has met his family, they went on holidays twice (with her children). They had the Instagram relationship launch. 
He initiated NC after he got his stuff back, while I was still in the mental health facility. We haven't talked since.

I am wondering. Is it possible for someone to rebound that fast after abuse? If he planned is escape?  Or is it a sign that I have been gaslighted into oblivion? 

What sign should I look for ?

6149,Recovery 7 months out - normal to still be depressed?,"Hi! 7 months ago I (32f) left a 2 yr abusive relationship with a man (35m). We were engaged and wedding planning. I finally had enough and left. For context, our relationship had all the greatest hits: stonewalling, namecalling, mocking, blaming for rly off the wall stuff, driving out of control to scare me, isolating me from fam and friends, yelling, swearing at me, DARVO, and on and on. 

I moved from our shared city back to my home city, where I have been supported so beautifully by family and old friends. I am believed and treated kindly by everyone in my life. I found an ok job, a cozy apartment, have made a few attempts at dating, had sex with one respectful person even tho I was pretty nervous and he was super chill and understanding. 

The thing is - I’m soooooo depressed. In April and May, I kinda thought I was doing better. Then June and July just plummeted, low energy, can’t stop napping, sad and crying all the time, social engagements are fine but I seem to need days to recover. Quit my job in July bc just couldn’t do it? I want to try boxing or something else to cultivate anger, but can’t seem to find the energy. And then I beat myself up for still being like this, for not having recovered yet, and for the mystery of it getting worse over time. 

Why is my mental getting worse 7 months later? Is this normal?

For the record, I don’t regret leaving and don’t want to go back. A couple months ago I listened to a recording I made of one of our fights - felt sick over how hard I was working, like I was playing chess for my life, just to have a conversation with this man, and he’s yelling and being cruel the whole time and I’m just white-knuckling keeping every fiber of myself under perfecr control.

6152,Found out that my emotionally abusive ex is happily dating the woman he was cheating on me with-- feeling weird feelings,"My ex was highly emotionally abusive to me for the year and a half we were together. The abuse escalated towards the end of our relationship, when I suspected that he was seeing someone else, though it was never confirmed. My ex ended up doing me the biggest favour he ever did, and broke up with me. This was all about 3 years ago. 

Shortly after that, he began a campaign of harassment towards me in an effort to get back together with me, which I staunchly refused. I suspected that the girl he may have been cheating on me with may have turned him down and that was causing his sudden desire to reconnect. 

This was all years ago, and since then, I have met and gotten engaged to the man of my dreams. I'm truly so happy with him I can hardly believe it. Truly, my fiancé is a god-send and my best friend. 

&#x200B;

Last night however, I was up late (coffee too close to bed time) and I ended up in an Instagram rabbit hole -- the worst habit. I found out that my ex is in fact dating the girl I had suspected he had been seeing towards the end of our relationship. And I felt a lot of feelings. 

&#x200B;

* Anger -- I am retroactively angry at him for cheating on me. I have zero feelings of attachment to him at this point and I had already suspected it, but I feel oddly betrayed now that I know it is true. 
* I feel like the fact that he is now with someone else, and making her happy, indicates in some way that the abuse way my fault. I know this is not true, but I cannot shake the feeling -- why is she worthy of being treated like a person, and I was not?

My boyfriend (28m) and I have been dating 3 years. Living together in his house he owns for almost a year. Things haven’t always been the smoothest. 6 months into our relationship we got into a fight. He picked me up from college and we drove to his family lake house (in a national forest). I told my parents what I was doing but they panicked and said they saw I was in a forest and they’d call the cops since they didn’t know what was going on. Eventually we moved past it but I think there’s always been some tension after that. 

He believes my family is controlling. My family believes he is controlling. These issues led to me starting therapy. I was told he was emotionally abusive but my family had controlling tendencies. 

Last year I was asked to be a bridesmaid in my friends wedding. We grew up together and went to the same college. My family was invited to the wedding. However, a boy I had a situationship with was invited to the wedding and my boyfriend was furious. He wanted me to not attend the wedding. This caused major issues in our relationship. To the point my family told me to move out because I was miserable. We fought constantly over this wedding. We ended up going to the wedding. But he was miserable the whole time and tbh I was too. 

Eventually I moved out of the house and we broke up for a little. He blames my family for forcing us to break up. However, we got back together and I’ve been living in his house again. Things were good between us, but He blames my parents for us breaking up and he says they have always treated him horribly.

6168,Scared That I’m Too Far Gone,"TW: Domestic abuse, mentions of suicide

Pretty much what the title says, I’m terrified that I’m too traumatised now to live a normal life or find happiness.

I had a pretty awful childhood. I was raised as a small child by a mixture of rich and mean adults and a severely mentally ill and abusive mother. From the age of 12 I was raised in the care system and any adults that I had just abandoned me.

I began having panic attacks at 14 and developed hypochondria.

I left care at 16 and began my struggle of living with unhealthy men because I had no money or resources to set up my own living situation. The emotional abuse started then.

At 20 I developed agoraphobia because the panic attacks were so severe. The men I’d end up dating from then on gradually got worse due to my vulnerability.

I’m now 27, agoraphobic as heck and in the most abusive relationship to date. I feel completely destroyed, hopeless and alone. I now know that I can through the help of my local council find an affordable place to live on my own but I’m now facing the fear of not being able to handle it. Of not being able to be on my own. My nervous system is shot and I honestly don’t know if it’s reparable. It’s breaking my heart that it’s reached this severity and I don’t know if it’s even possible to find happiness.

I suppose I just wanted to get reassurance that I might have a shot at life because I’ve never felt so low in my life and it’s scaring me.

We had 2 kids and a nice house in an amazing town and from the outside were a perfect family but he was a monster behind closed doors.  Controlled all the money (even though i worked FT) and was always screaming and physically, mentally, sexually, financially abusive.  I had alienated all my friends (still don’t have any) and family and he always told me he would kill me before he ever let me leave…he had cameras everywhere and tracking on my phone and car and I later found out even my work laptop.  He was a master manipulator and professional making 4x my salary…i knew I would never get out with the kids without a lot of evidence so I survived with him and kept the kids safe waiting for my opportunity.  In 2018 finally found my ability to escape and retain custody of the kids when he beat me up screaming he was going to kill me in a public place with many witnesses who came to my rescue and I’ve retained sole custody.  So many years later and court case over (he plead guilty and got no jail time), so much therapy and healing for the kids and I and i’ve completely rebuilt a life for myself and kids who are now both teenagers and spend less and less time with me (as teens do).

I’ve spent almost 3 years with this man.
Most of the time has been spent miserable and unhappy. When I would bring this up, it was brushed aside. I have mentally cheated on him in the past with texting my ex’s, but this time was bad. I had been miserable for months and his own dad had warned him he was about to lose me for good if things didn’t change. I had begged him to spend more time with me, spend more time with his family, help me clean, help with our son, help me with my car, etc, but it was always ‘I don’t have the energy for this’, ‘I’m busy’, ‘I can’t pause my game’, ‘I’m tired’. We both have jobs, but he makes more money than I do, this had been thrown in my face multiple times, along with my mental health. So I made a plan to leave, upon this plan I met someone Z(25), Z had been understanding and listened and was so very kind and wanted to put in the effort for a relationship with me and my son. One day J needed to use my phone so he took this time to check my Snapchat, he saw that Z had messaged me and started asking questions so I had told him that I didn’t want to be with him anymore and that I was done, J got angry and started a scuffle with our 2 year old (D) at our feet, when we left the bathroom he went out to his truck and grabbed his gun, put it to himself multiple times in front of D, and proceeded to call Z, threatening to kill him. When we got back inside the argument in front of D continued till he choked me in front of his sister who was holding D, when she yelled at him to let me go he went to run out of the house and as I was trying to follow him and get him to stop he swung around and hit me in my jaw. All of this in front of his sister and D.
Now J, is saying that it’ll never happen again, that he regrets it, and misses me and still loves me. He claims hitting and choking me was justified given the circumstances. 
I don’t know what to do because a part of me knows him and wants to give him the chance, but a part of me wants to leave because I know how abuse goes, I’ve been through it and so has he.

Anyways he rented an AirBnB a couple hours north of me and asked me to play half (which I did). With the idea we’d spend time together and actually have sex in a bed

Before we slept together the first time I told him about my past sexual assaults. In one instance I was forced to give oral and my head was held down, I was choked etc. 

Last night during our stay he demanded I give him oral. I was afraid so I did, he held my head in place and I was so scared I just did it. The smell and everything about it made me feel sick. 

We finished and I showered and once I crawled into bed I couldnt stop shaking. 

The weekend was pretty awful before all that, he hardly looked at me, he was gone both mornings before I even woke up. 
He was very detached until the point of actually sleeping with me. 

I really feel like he just used me for the sex he wanted and that was that. 
I feel sick to my stomach thinking about it. He knew my trauma and still pushed me into something I wasn’t comfortable with anyways. He pushed me to a boundary I knew and he knew I didn’t want to cross. 
So I’m wondering if this was SA or if I just got triggered by bad sex.",irrelevant,no,plausibly,no,plausibly,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,no,cannot be inferred
6199,Is this abuse or harassment or am I just being dramatic? Any advice on how to handle this situation?,"Going to try and make a long story short. So
basically I was dating this guy and decided to stop seeing him after he gave me an std and had treated me horribly for the entire 8 months. He says after he grabs his balaclava mask from me (the literal only belonging he has at my house) he will leave me alone. This was almost two months ago. I have asked him for a PO Box or address to mail it to him. I have let him know the two days of the week my
daughter is not home so I can meet him in a public place to give it to him, and I have offered to drop it off at the police station for him to pick it up. I am uncomfortable with him coming to my house because he has made numerous threats of either destroying my car, my stuff, or hurting me. He has ignored all the offers I have made him to get his mask back to him and every day pretty much says he is going to show up at my house and if I don't
give it to him he will cause damage to my car. At this point I am tired of living in fear. I want this mask out of my house and I want to be left alone by him. I'm  scared for me and my daughters safety now and I'm so fucking mad at myself for ever letting this guy know where we live. I'm so stupid. I feel like if I call
the police they won't do anything since he hasn't harmed me yet. I can't move because my lease isn't up and I simply can't afford it. I just don't know what to do.",no,no,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly
6201,My ex (27M) coerced me (26F) into being sexual with him…,"I recently broke up with my ex because he wasn’t taking me on dates. All he did was have us stay at home where he could emotionally/verbally abuse me and have sex with me. I needed more from him emotionally so I walked away.

I thought that the time apart may help him to realize that he needs to step up. So he called me while I was at a party and wanted to talk. When he arrived, we went in his car to park somewhere and talk.

I made it explicitly clear that I don’t care what he’s saying about wanting to step up and date. I need him to show me. I also made it very clear that I don’t want to have sex. He kept trying to make out with me and press for sex but I held my ground.

Eventually, after I kept saying no, he pulled out his p*bus and started to relieve himself. I was in shock because I still refused to do anything but felt extremely awkward/uncomfortable. Eventually, I helped him finish (barely; I don’t want to go into too much detail) because I didn’t want anyone to see us.

I also started to feel sad for him because I realized that he has a real problem. This isn’t the first time he’s done something like this and I just don’t know how to handle this.

For one thing, I’m scared of what he’d do if I actually rejected him. My sister keeps telling me I need to get a restraining order but she doesn’t understand that I can’t do that while he still knows where I live. It is not safe.

And also, I still do love him and am sad that he’s feeling/behaving this way. I know it’s not my responsibility at all.

6202,Why am I (26F) begging my emotionally abusive ex (27M) to talk to me when I was the one who ended it? Why do I regret leaving??,"I have been having severe anxiety for the past few weeks. I was having nightmares of my ex cheating on me and waking up drenched in sweat every night. I couldn’t stop ruminating and monitoring his social media activities to see if he was cheating again.

He showed up at my door on Valentine’s Day proclaiming that he wanted to commit to me and make us official. I took him back and things were okay for a little while but his old self slowly started to come back. He began saying hurtful things to me. He kept hanging out one on one with female friends. He’d plan dates with them but when it came to me he didn’t really want to go anywhere or do anything.

I explained to him that I was having a lot of anxiety about his female friendships. He told me that all my accusing is making him want to follow through with it just like he did with his ex.

When the weekend came, I asked him if we can plan activities so I have something to look forward to with him the way his friends do. He agreed in a short response but then didn’t text me for hours. Eventually I just decided I’m breaking up with him. I did it via text and blocked him.

I felt like ending this was the right thing but I immediately regretted it and felt like I should’ve given him a chance to think about it and respond. Since then I’ve been trying to contact him so we can at least close things out properly.

We always do this on and off thing where one of us exits abruptly then he comes back weeks/months later to start this cycle over. I just want to say goodbye to him and end this cycle properly.

At first I tried to be supportive and comforting and would reassure him, I felt uncomfortable with how he spoke to me and told him so but brushed it away ultimately because he wasn't like my ex, he wasn't physically hurting me, he wasn't trying to isolate me from my friends nor was he being horrible, he was just damaged. Then it happened again and again and I realised he was emotionally manipulating me and I was being drained because of it, so I ended it.

As soon as I ended it he started calling and begging so I blocked him then he text me and I explained that I was done because my inner peace means more to me and that he needs professional help and his response was to throw my last abusive relationship where I was forced to carry my son and was isolated from absolutely everyone in my face in a way to victim blame me. 


That showed me exactly what type of person he was and I blocked his number completely because I won't allow anyone to speak to me in such a way ever again and there will never be a second chance.

6207,I Instagram followed my abuser’s new ex.,"I (25f) was abused for 2 years by my ex (27m). The relationship ended 5 years ago when I gave birth to my son and I sought help to cut ties. I went through family court and reluctantly settled and arrangement for contact. I got support from a DV agency and got a lot of education about what abuse can look like, and over this time I’ve really become a stronger more vivid person.

I’m completely in control of my life now. I have a wonderful fiancé who is a therapist (he was never my therapist) so he completely gets why my reaction to certain triggers can be so defensive. It’s been a long journey but I sometimes when I’m feeling particularly grateful I feel like a bit of a success story.

In the last year, my son’s father ended his relationship with his girlfriend. I only found out because there was a couple of missed weekends when he didn’t pick our son up, last minute cancellations with no explanation etc, and then my sister scrolled past him on a dating app. That was about a year ago. 

Today my son asked when he was going to see her again. I said that I didn’t know because I don’t know the details of their relationship ending so I really couldn’t say for sure if he ever will. I searched on social media and saw that she unblocked me. For context, he would have described me to her as the crazy ex and told her that I would stalk her, and he was very convincing when you’re with him. Impulsively I hit follow and immediately regretted it, but this morning she accepted and followed me back.

Now what? I have a million questions for her, but we’re by no means besties. I recognise that if he was the same to her as he was to me, she will be in a different place on her healing journey. I really want to know if she wants to keep in touch for my son’s sake, she’s been around since he was a baby and he’s very fond of her, but again, we’re hardly even acquainted.

How can I approach a conversation with her without coming on too strong?

UPDATE: I hadn’t said anything for a couple of days, still unsure how to make it make sense and not sound crazy, when suddenly she messaged and said that I was right about everything, and she’s sorry she didn’t believe me, I’m in shock!

6212,Abusive relationship survivor still finding it hard to date 18 years later.,"I’m a 37 year old female. I was in an abusive relationship when I was 18. During this time I suffered a great deal. Everyday felt like hell. My boyfriend at the time had intense rage, was controlling, mentally, psychologically, physically and verbally abusive. I was completely alienated from friends and family. We never went out because I never knew what would trigger his anger and when it happened, he’d loose it no matter where we were. He yelled at me in public, threaten me etc. I stayed quiet in hopes of de-escalating the situation. I realized that in a situation like this people just stare at you and don’t get involved, so I knew I’d be in danger either way. He got very close to killing us in a car incident. He got very angry because he thought I was being flirtatious with a complete stranger that we literally just walked passed. He assumed that my making eye contact, I either knew him or “wanted him”. I was about 8 months pregnant with our son and he drove about 90 on the highway, swerving and telling me “we’re both going to die now, I don’t care”. I could tell a million stories that occurred during the span of 2 years. It took me years to heal and to rebuild myself to be the woman I used to be before I met him. I raised my son on my own and he’s a wonderful human. I started my own business and I am a successful and confident woman. 
When it comes to dating, I never stayed after the first red flag. I have very little tolerance for anger, or loud, controlling men. I realized how my ptsd shuts me down in these situations. I’m currently in a relationship where my boyfriend is very sensitive. His mood changes rapidly when he’s unhappy e.g when he’s hungry, when I ask personal questions, when he’s in an uncomfortable environment lots of things really. It’s still a very new relationship and I’m trying to get to know him. But his mood changes really trigger me. He’s introverted and told me that it does take him time to let people “in”. He’s not expressive. I am expressive, and I am more on an extrovert. I’ve tried to engage in activities where he’s feeling more comfortable and be open and he just reacts negatively to all of it. I also tried to break things off because we’re just so different. He always tells me he will open up more and try to do the things I need. But he also doesn’t understand why I’m so upset about it all. Truth is I just want peace. This is all I’ve ever wanted since then. I’m happy alone. Also maybe I do need profesional help ?

6213,Coping..,"I’ve struggled for a long time to talk about this in a somewhat public forum and I really need help. My mind is constantly racing with thoughts and I can’t seem to escape myself. I was discarded in October because I expressed my disappointment in him failing to show up for a Halloween date that I planned. I was left by myself on my birthday, when I tried my best to celebrate his the month prior. I had a miscarriage and was not really emotionally supported and found out he was cheating about two or so weeks after telling him I was pregnant.  Messages between him and the other girl showed him telling her I was a fling and he didn’t know if the baby was his or if he even wanted it.. while he was living in my home & when I asked him if he wanted me to abort, he said he would never have me get an abortion. I’m already a single mom and every day that passes gets harder. Fast forward to today, and he’s in a relationship with the same girl he told I was a fling and planning to see her although they live states apart.. but he couldn’t show up for me in the same city.

6216,I need to know if he's actually a narcissist,"I'm married to someone I dated for 6 years prior to our engagement. We've been together for a total of 7 years now and had a baby 5 months ago. I always knew he's ""a difficult person sometimes"" (at least that's how I would describe him until know) but I recently learned about narcissism and I he ticks some of the boxes - but seems otherwise so far from narcissism. For the sake of my mental health I just need clarity - am I really married to a narcissist? 

Why I think he may be one/ toxic behavior that he slowly started to display as we kept dating: 
- when we fight, his goal is not to resolve the fight. His goal is to ""win"" 
- he'll say hurtful things in a fight just to hurt you back - even if you didn't intentionally hurt him
- he says something that hurt you, then gets offended at you being hurt and somehow spins it so he's the victim
- I can't pinpoint how exactly but when we fight, he displays what we fight about so drastically different that I'm seriously questioning my reality. 
- when we fight, he gets super angry but never emotional - never once saw him cry during a fight. He'll keep being mean, won't back down, make things worse and punish you with silence until you have a breakdown, then it seems like flicking a switch and he's nice again. Almost like his goal to make you reach the point of a mental breakdown and then he's gotten the amount of pain he wanted and can stop punishing you. 


Now I know all of these points are horrible, narcissist or not. Writing this I can't believe I ended up marrying this man myself. But despite what it seems like: it's not all bad. It's bad when we fight, when we don't he's amazing. And since we just had a baby I'm really not thinking about leaving him right now.

He texted me about how he doesn't get me because we locked our bedroom doors and left without telling him. He knew where we were because I'd said in the morning that we were going to place. I explained that we felt unsafe. Didn't really talk the rest of the day. 

Today as he was leaving for the store, he asked if I was still angry. I told him I hadn't been angry, I'd been scared. He asked if I still was and I told him I'm always slightly scared of him. He left upset.

Messaged me about how he's scared of me and my ""sudden mood changes"" and he's sick of it. So I told him I'm done. I want to sell the house and move on. That I don't care if he dates and sleeps around this time. I just want to heal and provide a healthy space for daughter.

But the biggest one was his drinking and drink driving during the day.

For example, messaging me early hours of the morning asking me to call him as he is struggling, but when I call no answer.

6224,Is this a Hoover??,"Short summary - my stbx narc started dating without telling me back in the summer even though we haven’t been living together for over a year because of his addiction but we were still emotionally involved. We have two teenagers together so I can’t go n/c. 

Things would be different for me if he would have just been honest about dating but he wasn’t so once I found out he was serious with a new woman I moved on the divorce and I hope it will be finalized in the next 30-60 days. I tried to do a regular schedule of visitation with my 13 yo - the 17 yo sees him when he wants to. He totally lied to me over Labor Day about when he was getting my daughter and how long he was going to spend time with her so after Labor Day I haven’t had a phone conversation and have blocked him everywhere because of the manipulation and lies he shared in that phone convo. I will only communicate with a coparenting app. 

He also didn’t stay sober with his new supply either and I had to get a TRO for the kids’ safety so they only see him in a public place currently and my oldest son meets him wherever. He moved in with his new supply and her 4 kids right after his rehab stint in October and then relapsed again. I’m so glad he’s not my problem - it really is a blessing. 

He is supposedly 60 days sober but for me I’m no longer anyone to him but a coparent. Once he made his choice - he lost me except when it comes to our kids.  Part of me wants to give him a piece of my brain for how he threw our 20 year history away but then I think what’s the point? He sent this on Christmas and I know he’s not with his g/f or her kids based on what I overheard on a FaceTime with my son - he was visiting his family alone. 

In my brain if he’s getting a better, newer job, he can share with me when it’s done - not hypothetical ideas for his next career move. I think the timing is suspect and it feels like manipulation and that he wants to say something to me on the phone that he can’t put in the app. He didn’t share with me when he was introducing his new family to my daughter I found out after it happened and he didn’t even tell me he was moving in with her so why does he all of a sudden care to talk to me about career opportunities?",yes,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

* take myself out on a date and eat at restaurants
* eat cheez is
* watch what I WANT TO WATCH and have my streaming services I like (he refused to let me watch certain movies)
* put magnets on our fridge 
* have a beer
* spent 100’less on groceries every week
* play tennis and see my friends when I want
* I have NOT BEEN LOCATION TRACKED :) 
* used my hard earned saved money for what I want and need instead of house projects he demanded I pay for even though I wasn’t on the deed
* leave my sunglasses out
*do laundry when I want and whenever I want (I always got in trouble for the day i chose to do laundry) 
* now that my niece and nephew are in town can see them whenever I want and practice tennis too I won’t have to pick one

6226,Why would a narc sexually starve AND let their physical appearance go?,"I’ve been with my narc for 6 years. After a pregnancy scare in August, he had decided he has wanted to fully abstain from sex. 

I’ve wondered “who” the other girl is or “where” he is getting it from. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why he no longer cares about his physical appearance. 

On paper he looks good. Owns two businesses. Owns our home. Owns two cars (one is mine). 

But unlike the previous “discard” cycles, he isn’t doing anything to improve his appearance. In fact, I actually dated him because he’s far less attractive than anyone I’ve dated before. I just figured the odds of me getting hurt would be a million times less by knowing I’m out of his league. 

Ironically, he’s the person who has hurt me the most. 

He’s insanely overweight. Bald. Has old man lines when he lets his hair grow in.  And is doing nothing to improve his appearance.  And he has no real game. 

I think I played a major role in boosting his self esteem.  To a fault. 

The other day I got so mad I went to a random bar to have a drink. And I met a total stranger and told him exactly what I said above. 

And he said “if he’s rich. If he owns properties. No girl is going to care if he’s overweight. Especially if he can talk about the endless gifts he’s showered me with.”

I know holidays are difficult but it's two days past Thanksgiving now. One day past Black Friday. So why is today also so hard? Why do I want him here so bad? And then I realized. It's not *just* the first of these holidays without him and the kids, it's also the two month anniversary of being without him. Every day over the last 3 days coincided with an important date in September:

- Nov 23 (Thanksgiving) / Sept 23 (the last and most terrifying DV episode)
- Nov 24 (Black Friday) / Sept 24 (the day I went to the hospital, gave my police report, and dealt with the fall out from my nex's feelings of betrayal)
- Nov 25 (today and anniversary of whatever hell my nex put me through for ""ruining thanksgiving"") / Sept 25 (the last day I let my nex into my home. The last day I spoke to him. The last day I touched him. He showed up unannounced, held me, kissed me, apologized, and I was able to get him on audio recording admitting to all the abuse) 

It's a hard day. I've already cried in the shower and cried while getting dressed, my temper and patience are short, and I want to run away from everything and everyone.

We had been together for about half and a year. But I didn't get treated like the way I did. It was like only one way. I gave, I care, I showed love, like that. But at the end of the day, his instincts slowly came out. He slept with a prostitute while he was on a business trip with his family. And soon after I found about that he also sex chatted with the girl he used to date before me. And he also contacted all of the girls he used to went on dates. I was really suffocated and I cried loud. I know that it was a hard pill to swallow that I needed to stop right there. I talked with him very calmly. I asked a few questions of between us, only about us like "" Why are you doing this to me?"" And then he was like "" He did it because it makes him happy, we only got one live, we need to spend it happily"" that's what he said. I was shocked and then I asked him another thing . ""So do you really wish to replace me with those kinds of pleasure you got from those girls?"" He said ""Yes, he definitely would"". That's the closure for me to leave him behind. And he never apologized to me. Last night he kept calling me.

  
I feel really miserable that I don't want him to turn into a stranger to me. But I accept the situation and I will move on from now on.

6244,Does he sound like a narcissist?,"We’ve been married for 10 years. Been together for 14 in total & have 4 kids. We’ve had a lot of bad days and even years. Things have been slightly better lately but something just feels wrong. Not sure how to approach this. 

He’s had a really heavy porn & online dating issue in the past. Those problems seem to have gotten better & disappeared all together since 2022. He even downgraded his phone so that he can’t get those apps & stream high quality videos anymore. 

I’ve noticed a lot of narcissistic qualities in him that I feel have been getting worse. He’s one of the big guys at his office & everyday after work and on his way to work I listen to him talk about how everyone loves him & how great he is (Which he is a great & lovable guy in many ways) & in that same breath he tells me how much I should clean more, do more with the kids, etc. He never makes me feel like I’m great. With both my parents passing away only a few months apart it hurts not hearing from anyone that I’m doing a good job. I’ve told him this & he does apologize but then he just forgets he apologized and how I feel & then starts shitting on me again the next day. 

He gets really upset and annoyed if one of the kids interrupts his talking while we’re on the phone or if I zone out. He constantly tells me I’m wrong or don’t know what I’m talking about even with things I do know and must know because they’re about me and my own life. Anything you can think of, he’s going to tell me I’m wrong or try to debate about it. It’s really exhausting. 

Lately, he’s been working more and always at his moms house who lives 2 hours away. I’m really close to my in laws and he calls me on the way there and we talk the entire time and all that. I have no issues or trust issues with him being there. He’s been gone since Monday morning and won’t be back until Sunday then he’s staying over there again Tuesday-Thursday to take his family member to a doctors appointment and save on gas. A part of me just feels like he’s spending more and more time away from me because he doesn’t like me & feels more comfortable away from me now. Idk what happened.

Not sure what to do. Just feel blah about it all.

6245,Does anyone ever regret leaving?,"I am like 7 months out of my relationship. And I miss him like crazy. I have a mutual friend (legit only one who still talks to me), and she posted an instagram story with him in it not long ago, and i feel like I've been gutted like a fish ever since. I found myself really healing and doing well in therapy, I'm casually dating and enjoying it. But part of me yearns to run back. I miss our house, our dog, our little day trips. I feel like I made up all the negative elements sometimes. Maybe it wasn't all bad, maybe I should have just dealt with the bad because every relationship has negatives. I want to text him so badly, but it ended so poorly, I know it would just lead to heartache and more confusion and i know there's no chance whatsoever of repairing the line of communication. But why do I feel this way about someone who caused me so many sleepless nights? So many days of sadness and confusion. He's still with me even though I haven't seen him in over half a year. Part of me wishes I could erase memories but part of me is grateful for the memories. I'm just so shattered and twisted internally. I've been suicidal some days because I can't stop thinking it's all my fault. I wish I could just heal and move on. Sigh. Not sure what the point of this was, other than to say I'm sad.

6246,Worse Birthday Ever Because of Boyfriend,"My BF (M34) of 2.5 years I (F33) live with was cruel to me on my birthday Oct. 30th. I'm in shock at how bad my day became. I asked to spend a few hours at the beach (free hotel access). He got mad saying My BF of 2.5 years I live with was cruel to me on my birthday Oct. 30th. I'm in shock at how bad my day became.  
I asked to spend a few hours at the beach (free hotel access). He got mad saying I'm celebrating my birthday with friends next weekend but reluctantly came. After 3 hours of him hardly speaking to me at the beach said he was done, even though I wanted to stay. He said he was hungry and had a headache so wanted pizza. I told him I wanted to change to dress up for dinner, even if we don't go anywhere fancy. He got mad saying he took me to dinner Saturday, although he never said it was for my B-day, he wanted to go there for meat (I'm a vegetarian), and we didn't even have dessert after we went to a Halloween party. It was fun, but not for my birthday, no one said happy birthday, and we were with HIS friends.  
Upset but not wanting my day to get worse, I offered to pay for dinner on my birthday, I just wanted to dress up and celebrate my day. Plus it was 7 PM and too late to ask anyone else. At first, he refused then he came but was saying mean things the whole night, causing me to cry multiple times. I ended up paying $600 and he made sure to order the most expensive steak on the menu.  
To make it worse, I learned a friend passed away that night and that didn't stop him from continuing to say mean things. To be clear, his money and time availability were not the issue. I just wanted ONE DAY to feel special, be happy, dress up, and have my opinion matter. If he wanted to celebrate my B-Day dinner he would have been clear at the moment, not tell me it was my B-day dinner 3 days later.  
I'm grateful to go on dates, he can be very generous but it is sickening that he tries to hold financial purchases over my head. He even told me he was taking back my present because I didn't appreciate the Halloween party he took me to with his friends.I wish I celebrated my birthday alone.

6252,So I'm 6 months out,"I separated from my ex about 6 months ago. I have had some mountain top highs, and some rock bottom lows. I also moved completely across the country. I got a new jobim making more money and finding my independence. But I also cant help but think about him. It's like I want to run back, and go back to how it was before because I was ""used to it.""  Has anyone felt like this?

 So we're technically still married until next month, but ive met a guy who is actually incredible in this time frame. We met by chance, but I've been going on dates with him for over a month now, and it just feels like I found what healthy relationships can be like. On one hand, I'm worried I may be leading him on and I may be trying to rebound... on the other hand, I know I've been out with a couple guys from apps, and had some casual sex, and found none of that was for me. Idk what I'm trying to say other than I feel fucking GUILTY. like, my stbxh is clear across the country and we are legally separated, but I still feel like I need to run back to him and beg for forgiveness. How tough was it for you to start dating again? How did you ""learn to unlearn"" unhealthy attachments from a narcissistic relationship... also, I worry I'm going to be judged. Or moreso how i will be perceived. Like I feel like people are going to judge me for pursuing a relationship so soon, but I also have never felt like this and I'm also so unsure. 

Long story short, my narc relationship FUCKED with my head and I'm now worried I'm either (1) leading someone on, (2) trying to hide my discomfort by dating, or (3) going to sabotage what could become a very healthy partnership.

6253,Halloween First Holiday Without Him,"Halloween will be the first holiday without my nex and his kids. It's difficult because everywhere I go, my mind is flooded with memories of picking out Halloween costumes, picking and carving pumpkins, decorating the house, trick-or-treating with the girls. 

Were things between my nex and I absolutely horrible this time last year? You fucking betcha. This time last year he was screaming that he hated me and my house was a prison, he would scream until I cried, get more enraged, and then begin punching himself in the face in front of me--telling me it was *my* fault he was hurting himself, which made me cry even harder. 

So why does my brain keep going back to the good memories? The holding hands and smiling/laughing in public, the getting dressed up and gallivanting around town acting like two fools in love, the time spent celebrating and decorating with the kids. I was a miserable wreck and forcing myself to keep it together. So what makes the holidays so reminiscent? 

I'm missing a feeling and a desire that was never even there. I'm missing the *idea* of the love-filled family life he promised me. I'm missing the feeling of companionship, of having someone on my arm to call my own, of having someone to snuggle up with and tell jokes and be intimate. But did he really even offer those things to me in a genuine way? No. Only enough to keep me on the hook and coming back for more. Only enough to get more ammunition to use against me. Only enough to keep me questioning which version of him was real. There was no safety or security in that. 

There was no comfort in his embrace because each time he was gentle and intimate with me, I found myself wondering who else he shared that part of him with while we were together. Who else was he talking to now that I didn't know about. Who was he having over or where was he going each time I had to leave for work. I couldn't enjoy him anymore, relax around him, sink into him. I was always guarded and carefully watching, waiting for him to slip. Where is the comfort in that?

I guess I have to write it out to remind myself. He was fake. He was a liar. He was a loser. He did not deserve me. And I did not deserve that kind of betrayal, that kind of abuse. 

This is my first holiday without him and his kids. It will be the first of many anniversaries and landmark memories that I spend without them in my life. I'll hold my head high, I'll keep my heart close, and I'll get through it. And hopefully, as each landmark memory and anniversary date goes by, it'll hurt a little less and I'll heal a little more.",no,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
6258,my boyfriend doesn’t want or allow me around his friends,"me F20 and my boyfriend M19 have been dating over a year. we’ve got our fair share of issues in this relationship but this is one thing i can’t understand. basically throughout the entirety of our relationship, he has never invited me to hangout with him and his friends, never taken me to any events or parties with them, etc… we have mutual friends and all of his friends know we are together and have met me before we started dating (we all went to high school together). i’ve been told not to come to mutual friends birthdays on multiple occasions, encouraged not to attend parties they have thrown that his friends explicitly invited me to etc… the most recent issue i had with this was when i was at his house and he told me his girl friend was coming over to go on a community bike ride that happens in my city weekly. keep in mind i am friends with this girl and am not worried about them being friends (they have been friends since elementary). anyways she shows up with her girl friend and i was a little annoyed at this point because i explained to him that i really wanted to go on this bike ride, but every week he has some excuse as to why he can’t go with me and MUST go with his friends instead. so here he is sitting with two girls in his living room, i’m obviously annoyed and when he made no effort to invite me to come bike with them, i decided to leave. he was upset that i was upset and basically made a ton of excuses as to why i couldn’t come with them, etc. if this was two of his guy friends i would have understood and probably not even wanted to go with them, but since it was two girls and just him i was quite annoyed that he still wouldn’t let me. he ended up going with them and saw no issue with it. he’s told me in the past that he wants friend time to be friend time and time with me to be time with me, and when i explained to him that i won’t ask to go with him and his friends on the bike ride again because he obviously doesn’t want me around his friends, he said yeah, basically confirming that he doesn’t want me around them. please let me know your thoughts and opinions on this !! tysm",irrelevant,no,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
6265,Crying a lot more since dating my girlfriend?,"Ever since I (F22) started dating my girlfriend (F20) (almost 1.5 years ago) I’ve noticed that I cry a lot more. Like a LOT more. 

To be clear, she has been nothing but wonderful and supportive and she has changed so many things for the better for me. She gives me space to be vulnerable and feel safe and she actually puts in the effort to try to understand me even when I know that it isn’t always the easiest (long history of mental illnesses, etc.)

I’ve never been much of a crier. Throughout my childhood and teens, I could go for years without crying and the few times I did cry, it was because of academic stress. Crying from emotional or physical pain was extremely rare for me and I can honestly count on one hand the instances that it has happened. 

Then when I started dating my girlfriend, it’s like some mechanism in my brain unlocked and crying just comes so much more easily and with much fewer/less intense triggers. Even just thinking about how much she cares about me and wants to be there for me can make me start tearing up.
The intensity of emotions isn’t necessarily something new to me, but the crying response definitely is. 

Has anyone else had this or a similar experience? Is this something that should be concerning or is it something good? Both? 

My increased rate of crying hasn’t really affected me in a negative way, just a little jarring sometimes because it’s something out of my control. 

TLDR: Been crying a lot more since I started dating my girlfriend. I get emotional when things like her caring about me and wanting to be there for me come up, whether in conversation or just in thought. Should I be concerned or is this just part of a “healing” process? ",irrelevant,cannot be inferred,no,no,no,,no,cannot be inferred,no,no,no,no,no,no

He also apologized to his best friend after we left and told her “I hope my gf didn’t annoy you or bother you, I’m sorry we couldn’t spend more time together.” He’s told her that we fight all the time (we genuinely don’t) And to top it all off he told his friends he wants to move back home “maybe with maybe without my gf” and to not tell me about it. 


 He has never ever brought any of this up to me. I feel beyond hurt and confused. Our relationship has felt solid and healthy and this absolutely slapped me in the face. I had no doubts until now.

Sorry for mistakes, english is not my first language!

Me(f19) and my ex bf(m20) were together for 9 months. At the end of our relationship everything wasn’t going good, we were fighting a lot, he admitted that he felt a lot of anger and hatred towards me.  A month ago we went on vacation, but during the whole time we had almost no sex. On the last night before I left, he initiated sex, but everything was very strange.  He started kissing me, and then abruptly squeezed my neck very hard and threw me onto the bed, I screamed and hit my head. We had sex and he was very rough, I was scared because I saw aggression in him, I could not speak or stop him.  He hurt me, was very tough(but not in the usual kinky way), when it was over he just got up and went to the shower.

I flew back home and we weren’t talking for a while, but yesterday he texted me saying that he got no explanation for his behavior, he said that “something took over him” and that he was angry. 

I don’t know how to feel about it, because i didn’t actually told him to stop during sex (because i was too scared), so for him it seemed kinda consensual. But i’ve been feeling really bad after this, i throw up every time i think of him, i have crazy anxiety, i even had to change my therapist.

I was in a physically abusive relationship with my ex bf for 2.5 years.

My ex agreed that he would stop and for a few months he did but then we had a small fight over sleep and it escalated. (Trigger warning/graphic) He punched me several times and strangled me.

I F(29) been with my partner M(39) just over a year and we have a 4 month old son together, I packed up my life to be with this guy and he turned out to be a lying, manipulative, controlling narcissist.

I dated a man (31M) for 2 years.

Or maybe one of the times he told me that I make him want to kill himself. When he threatened to leave and said he was done with me over petty arguments I should've been the one to go. 

I should've valued my own self respect over his feelings. Over the fear of losing him. I have spent 2 of the past 3 years apologizing for who I am, and the past year has been me fighting for respect and acceptance for myself AND my 6 year old. I should have made sure I did better for him. I feel so guilty and stupid because I knew I didn't want or need a relationship when I met him. But he wanted more with me, right away, so, granted. And I dont think he is a terrible person. I think he really wants to be a good man but he has issues I'm not equipped to handle, and I can no longer sacrifice my sanity for. I don't hate him but I was starting to. 

We had some amazing times and he took care of us financially when I was between jobs, but has damaged me mentally and probably my son too. And the good is no longer worth it when the love is causing me depression. Missed days at work. Productivity in the dump when I'm there. Might lose this job too as I dont know when I can go back because I don't know when I'll sleep again. It's been 3 days since I've slept more than a doze. Have I just been living a facade? I have so many questions and doubts and regrets running through my mind. I don't want to give up what we have but I am so tired and fed up. I never thought I would be crying listening to the weeknd over him.

6310,Advice on healing when staying together?,"Me [f/27] and my boyfriend [27/m] have been together 10 years this year, and its been a long learning process for me.

I had a rough childhood, i wont get into it much here but though there wasnt much in the way of physical abuse (maybe a handful of incidents) there was definitely emotional. I was a virgin and massivley shy when i met my now bf. I had an undiagnosed anxiety disorder (im now medicated and on top of it) and could barely even introduce myself to people, but when we met I was drunk so i was much chattier. I pursued him, mostly. 

Over the first year there were a handful of physical incidents. Once he held a knife to my throat, gave me a black eye ect. He was at the time using a lot of drugs as well, mainly acid, though i didnt know, and he was going out with me and our friends every weekend and getting blackout drunk. He was constantly emotionally abusive. He made me feel like i was worthless. At the time i was living at home in an already abusive home, trying to escape.

He apologised, realising he was wrong around a year and a half in, stopped using acid and the psysical absue stopped. He became an all round a lot better boyfriend and we moved in together. But the drinking and emotional abuse continued, though the emotional abuse only whem he was drunk. Mostly. Sometimes it would be when he was sober too. 

He eventually stopped  being emotionally abusive when he was sober, id say after about 2-4 years of our relationship. It just trickled out. He was still an awful drunk, drove away a lot of our friends, he was aggressive to them and to me when drunk, though by this time never physical. This went on until maybe 2 years ago, when an incident with our friends caused him to stop drinking after they threatened to cut us out of thier lives.

Now the emotional abuse and the drinking has stopped. I've had 2 years of healing to do. Hes become this person i never thought he would be sober. Hes ashamed of his past, supports me in every way, loving , stable. Im more confident than ever, healing allowed me space to grow. For the first time in my life i have my own friends, income, purpose ect.

So why cant i heal fully? I have this growing nagging feeling of hurt about the whole thing. Ive forgiven him, or so i thought, but its been plaguing me. I had a conversation with him about it and he suggested i go to therapy, he was very supportive, but still.I feel a little bit empty, like something is missing. What am i missing?

6335,I feel alone. A thread for women who feel abused in their relationships and have no one to talk to about it.,Hi my name is Gabriella  I don’t know if anyone will see this but I have no one to talk to. 8 months ago I fell in love with a guy who was everything I wanted. I was a server and he was one of my regulars. The way we fell in love was more than beautiful we spent the summer spend time together every single day I would miss work just to be with him. Yes there was some red flags early on with his temper but I could deal with it back then. I thought since I’m crazy he’s crazy and we are a perfect match. But when we moved in together and I lost my jobs. It been hard for me to find work. He took on all the bills. I know it stresses him out taking on all the bills and me being so depressed but recently he’s been cold mean and distant. Like today Valentine’s Day and he being so mean about it these was the text he sent today. I’m already suicidal but to do this is so hurtful I just can’t leave him. He loving and sweet he was the person who made me wanna live and now he’s changed I hate talking abt this with other people that I know. I rather talk to strangers.

6337,Can verbally abusive people change?,"My bf (29M) and I (24F) have been together for 4 years now, we met in college and moved together after a year. We recently purchased a home together. He is practically the “perfect man” with one big flaw, his temper. His biggest triggers is when he is interrupted or when he’s stressed. 

In the past 6 months we starting seeing a therapist. This was decided at my breaking point of wanting to call it quits after a horrible fight because I walked away from him when I wanted to come back to it later. He called me every name out there and yelled at me, worthless, stupid, b!tch, you see the point…I broke it off and was willing to sell the house before even one year of buying. He knew I’ve had it and insisted we seek therapy. It’s been helping ( I think) since he went 2 months without losing his cool and calling me names. But recently he mentioned he would “slap me” if I turned down the music after we had gotten into an argument in the car. He has never physically threatened me. Later he mentioned he wouldn’t actually do it just wanted to get my attention and wanted me to stop..
I just don’t know what to do…he’s literally perfect every where else and is making efforts in changing as far as taking responsibility goes and going to couple therapy sessions 2 times a month. Can people change this part of themselves or is this engrained? I don’t want to continue if there’s no hope of permanent change.

6338,Finally left my physically abusive boyfriend last night.,"My boyfriend and I have dated for 7 years now. He was this sweet goofy Italian guy and I’m central asian. We were each other’s first partner/love. We met in class at 18 years old and got together shortly after. We were together for 3 happy years until he snapped. I wanted to go home because we had a test the next day and he wanted me to stay. But I still try to leave and he gets really angry. He says I don’t care about him. He corners me in the room and hits me in the face. My nose starts to bleed. This entire thing happened in like 3 minutes. He cries, apologizes, swears it’ll never happen again, says he doesn’t know what came over him etc. He drives me to the hospital while sobbing. 

I was in shock. He showed his true colours. I forgave him shortly after. The reason? I grew up in a physically abusive household. My mom forgave my dad over and over. My brother was also abused. My mom finally left my dad when I was 17 and he committed suicide 1 month later. I’m glad he’s dead, but my brother misses him and blames my mom. Abusive relationships are complex and trauma bonds are so hard to break. Despite what my boyfriend did to me, I still loved him and tried to overlook it. 

We got back together shortly after the assault. 4 years have passed and the relationship was great. He didn’t hit me again and everything felt like how it used to be. The plan was to move in together next year but I can’t fully trust him. I don’t want to risk it and I need to end it now. I read it takes women about 6 times to fully leave their abuser. I’ve tried it before but I always came back because he acts so sincere. 

Anyway, I’m 25 now. It sucks that the best years of my life were wasted on this. I have PTSD due to the assault and he would try to help me. It’s so traumatizing that someone who loved me for years would do this to me. I just don’t understand it and I don’t trust guys anymore. I’m currently on the waiting list for a therapist.

6341,Is he abusive or was it just the heat of the moment?,"My husband and I have been married for tree years now, known each other for five years.
We had an argument yesterday, so in the middle of it he hit me in the face. He immediately said sorry after it but got really angry when I talked back asking wtf his problem was. I was crying at that point and tried to get to my car to leave, he then grabbed me by the neck and dragged me back inside the house.
We fought and exchanged insults and finally crying my eyes out I managed to get to my car and leave. He keep yelling at me from the front door. 
We just bought a house - we were arguing there about how to do certain things with the renovation. 
I’m going through a burn out atm, not working but still getting my salary because I’m on sick leave. I guess I’ll be going back to work next month. So for now I’ve been at home and because of us buying a house I don’t really have savings of my own. He has his own company and is the main provider, he does well. But somehow because of investments we did together I didn’t manage to save up money. 
I just don’t know what to do now, I am actually questioning if this is the kind of marriage I want to be in. But at the same time everything seems just to complicated between us to separate and I don’t think I can sort things out for myself given that we obviously live together and have properties together. 
I’m thinking of taking a small trip somewhere just to think about what to do to and to scare him too. I want to teach him a lesson. I think if we continue being together and I let this pass he will do it again and worse next time. 
I don’t have any family around since I live abroad. Even if decide to leave I don’t know where I’d go or where to start.

6347,How long did it take for your partner to become physically violent?,"TW: physical/emotional abuse. Just posting this out of intrigue more than anything - I am 5 months out of an 18 month coercive controlling relationship. I'm trying to better understand my own experience, what it could have led to, and how not to end up there again - so I'm pretty regular on this sub.

A lot of people have said to me that my situation definitely will have turned violent and tbh I have wondered - we never lived together and the times when his parents weren't around were the times when his aggression would escalate. I would be really interested to know others experiences; how long did it take for things to escalate from emotional abuse to physical, did things escalate when you moved in together etc. 

On a side note - I reported him to the police (I'm in the UK and coercive control is against the law) so I'm hoping if a woman has a similar experience with him she can access the DV disclosure scheme and understand this is a pattern of behaviour.

6349,I feel alone all the time.,"Something I wrote in 2021 about my ex: 

We’ve been together 3.5 years, and we got married a week ago. We’ve had so many problems over the years, but we always get through them. Somehow as our wedding grew closer I found myself realizing how little time he spends present with me. We will sit in the same room, watch the same show, or eat at a restaurant. But we don’t talk. We don’t engage in anything together. I feel like we are mindlessly living side by side and he’s perfectly happy the way things are because he gets to play video games for 8 hours a day, then watch YouTube, then watch a show, rinse repeat. He’s happy in our relationship and any time I bring up my unhappiness, he just gets defensive. He says I’m attacking him by saying I’m unhappy. Today he asked me for a solution and I said we could figure it out together. He said that he doesn’t have to figure out anything because it’s my unhappiness and not his. So again I’m left to just feel all this alone…I don’t have a family. I don’t have any friends. Somewhere in the last three years I lost everything, and now I’m lost myself.…I’m so tired of life. Tired of everything. I’m not really looking for advice, I just needed to write this out. Get something small out of my head before everything just stops.



What I’m experiencing now after leaving: 

I wrote this about 3 years ago now and it was never posted anywhere because of rules of communities or whatever. 

It’s been 6 years since I got together with that man and a year since I got away from him. I feel so broken. I was kind in that post about what was going on. 
He was SA me frequently since we got together, he was physically violent as well as emotionally distant or aggressive. 

He gave me PTSD. Sometimes when I’m with my now partner in bed, their face morphs into his and I’m terrified.
I wake up in the middle of the night after having nightmares of him, so I stay up late to try and avoid sleeping and seeing him. I see him in everything I do. It’s like he’s haunting me. 

I don’t know how to get past it. I’m going to therapy, I’m trying to go over it and heal it and I’m getting nowhere. I hate it. I hate living in my body and in my mind. I wish I could erase him from my mind but even after a year of being away he’s still here every day.

Her son and I got married and moved in together seven months ago. His true self showed then and has continued to get worse. I don’t want to go into details, but it finally reached a point where I felt I needed someone to know what’s going on. 

I worked up the courage to send her a long message explaining the situation. I wasn’t sure if it was appropriate to tell her. She didn’t know what to say. She told me I put her in a difficult position, and that she needs time to think and pray on everything I told her. She said she will talk to me tomorrow (it’s late at night). For my safety, I asked her not to tell my husband I messaged her.

I've spent most of the last 5 years trying to process what happened in our relationship and ending up in two emotionally abusive relationships after.

When we were together he was controlling and jealous, he insulted my family and friends and would scream at me during arguments. Towards the end of the relationship he got in my face in anger and pushed me and we broke up soon after. A lot of things I don't remember, so it's really hard to hold onto exactly what happened. He would twist things so I was always apologising and he'd get really angry, really quickly over how I said certain words or he'd deliberately misunderstand things I said so that he'd say I'd insulted him. There were a lot of rules and I always tried to follow them but they kept changing.

He just sent this:

""Hiya (ME) - this is probably long overdue and I genuinely hope you're doing well.

 This may be a bit out of the blue, but I wanted to offer you an apology for my behaviour during our time together.

My daughter, taken at 3 Years old, lived with only with me until we moved in with her father when she was 1. We all lived together until he and his mother kidnapped her and took her out of state. We were literally living together when this happened, but i was in the process of moving me and my daughter out and into a DV shelter. 

No custody, means no kidnapping. It's only illegal to take a child across state when custody has been established  or you are married. If you were never married, it's not kidnapping and no amber alert goes out. I'm struggling with this right now. I'll post another time about the details and where I'm at with all this. It's too much at the moment. 

Anyone who can share their experience and/or resources would be appreciated. I don't think I'll be able to check for comments until tomorrow evening, but I will check them.

6380,Just need to talk; How bad was it really?,"So I'm a 23 female and I just need someone that doesn't know me or my life tto talk to about all of this. I need help piecing everything together to see how bad the relationship really was.

For the sake of privecy, I'll refer to my ex throughout this as Vic.

I met Vic six months ago through a mutual ex friend, I was new to the city and literally just got out of the mental hospital myself. We talked on the phone at first and after a while, I asked if he wanted to hang out. Really it wasn't like I had anything else to do and I was pretty much homeless at that point.

This is how the probllem starts

literally after talking in person after like four or five hours, he asks me to marry him. I had colmly explained how I was married before and she tuurned out to be very abusive, so marrriage wasn't something I wasn't just going to jump into right away again. He understood, then asked me again a few days later in front of people. I just said yes, but stressed that I wouldn't get married until a year from now, even though everyone around me was saying to go the court house. I felt Iwas triggered so I explained again that I can't go through that again, not until I feel ready.

Keep in mind for the next six months that he would keep asking, I'd say no, and hhe'd get upset aboutt it, but ultimetly let it go.

this is where the questions would come in, to help really piece things together in my mind.. In advance, I have tto give a trigger warniing of emotional, psychological, possible sexual and finantial abuse. As well as a trigger warning for attempted suicide

6383,Can the abuser and the abused heal together?,"

First of all I'm a cis female 31 years old with a mtf 31 years old (she came out a couple months ago).  We've been together for 8 years.  The first 4 years I was in a deep depression and very timid.  The man who is my now wife used to physically, mentally, sexually, and emotionally abuse me.  Over the 4 years after that my wife slowly started to work on herself, getting on medication, going to therapy.  I slowly became stronger and realized I deserve better and started asking for it.  We are both still working on ourselves and trying to improve our relationship.  It's just extraordinarily hard.  No matter how different she seems I still get triggered by words, phrases, motions, actions, etc.  She gets upset, mad, frustrated every single time I get triggered and tells me she wishes I could just forget about it and leave it in the past.  I wish I could erase all of the trauma I experienced but it's just not that easy.  We both love each other and we're trying to make things better but we both sometimes question if we can both continue to get better if I continue to be triggered and she is constantly reminded of what she did to me in the past.  If anyone has any advice or suggestions I would greatly appreciate it.  ",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
6386,Have you ever been with someone who was really mean to you behind your back?,"TW: I was in a relationship before this one that had some DV. However, the relationship I am in right now it really seems like my boyfriend like is mean to me behind my back with other people. I think he puts me on speakerphone and has his friends there and tells me that he’s by himself. What happened most recently was I called him and he said he was doing a background check on his phone for work so he had to put me on speaker, but he got really annoyed the more I talked to him because he said he couldn’t do his background check which is why I thought I was on speaker in the first place but then a few hours later he called me asking for some information on his passport. I would think if he was actually doing his background check then he would’ve asked for it sooner rather than three hours later….When I’ve called him other times, I’ve heard people just kind of muttering things in the background and he’ll be really cold and distant ( kind of treat me like everything I’m saying is annoying)(lot of awkward silences)when we’re on the phone versus when we’re spending time together the vibe and how he acts is very different. He is generally nicer in person and is also willing to ask questions if he took something the wrong way, or there was a misunderstanding of some kind. When I go places with him when I leave the room, I hear him laughing with everyone there and it feels so incredibly different than when we’re together. We’re supposed to be moving states soon and I thinking about calling it before we get to that point because we’re going to be moving somewhere where I would be on my own, and we would be surrounded by those same people. So I’m wondering if anyone else has been through this where they suspected their partner was being mean to them with other people (almost bullying) how you handled it.

A few weeks ago I finally left my Narc husband after 6 years together and two married. I Got the green light from an atty to take my two kids out of state where my family lives for a place to live/ emotional support while figuring out the divorce process. 

It was recommended to me by my atty that I leave Nhusband in the dark about my intentions of divorce until gaining residency in a new state so I wouldn’t have to return to that state to fight the divorce. (6weeks) 

(Next part) for the past two years I’ve also come to the realization that I am, In fact, a lesbian. Nhusband does NOT know this although thinks I’m bisexual but has made many jokes about me being a lesbian/ him being my “cover”. 

Is this something Nhusband could potentially manipulate and use against me in some way?? I am terrified that he will do anything and everything he can to hurt me. Is it better to come out before he uses it in court some way and be prepared for it? Or is it better to try to hide it?

6396,Court is next Monday,"This will be our first time in front of a judge since I left 73 days ago. I have not seen my daughter in 53 days. 

We had a hearing sooner but I let him gaslight and convince me to get my lawyer to cancel it. That we could work this out together and not waste all the money on lawyers. That we knew our daughter better than anyone else and we should make a plan for her. We started it but I would not agree because he only wanted me to have 20% custody after it has been me that has always been there for her for the 8 years she has been alive. 

I was a stay at home mom, not by choice but was not allowed to have a job. I never had access to a debit card for our joint bank account. When I did go with him to work (he is a sub contractor sometimes) he would not ever give me any money. He played World of Warcraft for 10-18 hours a day. I would provide sexual favors in order to sleep in my own bed. I was raped multiple times a month but “saying no doesn’t count when you are married”.

But now he has changed into super dad. His kids are his top priority! And I am horrible because I don’t come to see my daughter at his house. He has made arrangements with me to bring her to a public place and then canceled them last minute claiming it wasn’t okayed by his lawyer and only seeing her at his home is acceptable. 
I also once told him during a fight that I would prefer he take me off her birth certificate rather than let him control my life forever. I am afraid he will use this and say to a judge look she doesn’t want her daughter. I was upset and tired of him treating me like the bad guy. 

I miss my daughter. I have been in therapy since I left, I got a job working for his pool companies competition. For now I live with my parents until I figure out what he is going to do to my life.

6398,Projection and Parenting,"My STBXN does not have a driver's licence or insurance.  He does have a car that he drives around illegally, not my circus, not my monkeys.  BUT I have told him that I am not OK with him driving our children around when he has visitation.  Now I will admit that I knew about this for years while we were together, and let him dive the kids.  I was never OK with it, but I was in the middle of being abused and felt like I had no choice.  You know how it goes.

I have done everything in my power to facilitate him still getting visitation with our kids with this new boundary in place.  I have even driven them to his house and picked them up.

He had visitation last week and here is what happened.  The kids were with him less than 24hours when I got a call from our daughter (14f).  She started begging me to let their Dad drive them around.  She said it was too hard to take the bus or a cab to do anything, and why was I punishing her for his mistakes.  I could hear is influenc in everything she said.  It was a tough conversation.  I explained that it wasn't me, every time he got behind the wheel he was breaking the law, and that I didnt want her or her brother around that.  That if they got in an accident while with him their was no insurance to pay bills if they got hurt.  I told her that if/when he had his licence and insurance he could drive them all he wants.  He just needs to get that done first.  He has the power to solve the problem, it's his choice if he doesnt.  

Later, when my kids came home I had a conversation with my daughter.  Her father told her that the only reason I am not letting him drive them around was because he was no longer useful to me.  That when we were together I needed him to drive them around to make things easier on me.  (While we were together he didnt do squat for our kids, never picked them up from school, never drove to a lesson, or game...nothing).  Now that I didnt need his help any more I was ""throwing him away.""  

OMG,  this is what he has done to me.  I stopped playing his games and put down some basic boundaries in my life and now I am the one discarding him. He is so twisted that he thinks everyone acts and thinks just like him.  I used to defend my self to him when he would tell me what I was thinking and feeling, now I know it pointless, but the further I get away from him the more I see what an absolute monster he is.",yes,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
6406,Does anyone else fall asleep while being yelled at (or even when speaking yourself during a fight)?,"Just wondering whether any of you folks do something similar. For the last two years, my husband argues with me almost every night, wanting to know why I neglected him all our 20 years together (pretty sure this is bogus - I only had issues with having sex, but I craved affection and thought I showed a lot of it). 

Sometimes I will freak out (to the point where we think I’m autistic because of the meltdowns I’ll have), screaming or trying to hunker down in the bathroom till I calm. I can’t handle the contradictory memories, the guilt he makes me feel, and just the stress of talking for hours on end.

But for awhile now, I will doze off in the middle of us arguing. I literally cannot stop myself. It’s awful. I’ll wake up with jolts of adrenaline and feel so awful, or he will do things like nudge me, push me, put his cane on me to try to keep me awake because it’s so irritating to me. I will also fall asleep in the middle of a sentence that I’m trying to say… I’m doing it tonight, actually. 

Have any of you had this happen? I think it’s a freeze response of some kind maybe? Or dissociation? I honestly don’t know…",cannot be inferred,yes,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
6411,I (30F) ended a relationship with my partner (31F) and am second guessing myself. Did I make the right decision?,"We’ve been together for almost two years and have lived together for a year. Throughout the time we’ve been together, we’ve struggled a lot with jealousy. Which is ultimately the reason why I ended things.

I felt tension whenever we’d hang with my friends and she’d often pick fights when I’d hang with a friend. Recently, I had the last straw when we went to hang with an old friend, and my ex told me I wasn’t giving her enough attention. So, I called it because I realized that this type of jealous was something that’s been consistent in our relationship. No matter how much I’ve addressed it, it never actually changed.

Now, I can’t stop missing her. I’m still very much in love with her and I feel confused about my conflicting feelings. I miss life with her and I love being around her. I’ve never felt such an intense depression like this. It’s also killing me that I hurt her - all I want is for her to be happy.

 On the other hand, I don’t want to hesitate about making friends or seeing my friends. I want my partner to support my friendships. 

Did I make the wrong decision? How do I get through this?

6413,"When my (23F) husband (25M) wants sex, I feel like I have no choice in the matter. What should I do?","My husband has a high sex drive and mine used to be pretty high as well until a few months into our marriage. (We’ve been married 1 1/2 years) Pretty soon I discovered that if my husband initiated sex, and I wasn’t feeling up to it, there was no way to tell him no without him getting upset. That usually leads to arguments that leave him in a mood for the rest of the week. I eventually start to just fake it and go along with the sex just so he won’t get upset. But he eventually figures out I’m not enjoying myself and that starts the process of our week long arguments again. He also goes on rants about how we’re young newly weds and we’re supposed to be having sex all the time because that’s what everyone else does.  It’s truly exhausting and makes me want to avoid sex all together.  

My husband also used to swear up and down that it was my birth control causing the issue with my sex drive. He convinced me to switch the pills I was on (twice) and when that didn’t work he went on about how an IUD would be better. I was TERRIFIED of getting an IUD but couldn’t stand the constant arguments so decided to make the appointment. The procedure was painful and I  cried in the doctor’s office because of how scared I was. It’s done now though and I’ve had my IUD for about 5 months. After messing with my birth control for the last year, my hormone cycle is completely screwed up and I am still experiencing severe cramps several times a month because of it. My husband started noticing how often I have to sit/lay down because of the pain and he’s now saying I should just get the IUD removed. But I am not ready to have kids and refuse to go without some sort of protection. My husband won’t use condoms.   

I have tried to communicate to him that it was never the birth control that affected my sex drive but rather his reactions and the way he treated me for not wanting sex. He doesn’t listen and just starts saying how if maybe he made more money or if he was better looking then I would like him more and want to sleep with him…. I truly have no idea what to do.

But I just logged onto my venmo to see if my ex-husband sent me money for our children like he promised and the first thing I see is AP’s face. “Stop with the carnitas” she said in her message to him. A wave of panic instantly overtook me, I broke out into hives, felt like I was going to vomit, couldn’t breathe. I’m glad they are out there having a great time at their little mexican fiesta and I’m over here alone with a toddler and a 3 month old, 17 pounds down in the last month because I’m so sad that I cant eat.

Now I cant eat but if I could I’d be eating my carnitas alone. I just wasn’t prepared to see that. If we didn’t have children I could go no contact and I would be so much better.

My reality is that my husband cheated on me the whole time I was pregnant, he devalued me, micro-manipulated me, he sent his girlfriend a picture of himself holding our newborn while i was in a hospital bed right next to him, she replied “i think i just fell even more in love with you, if thats possible”, she knew I was pregnant and that he was married, that we just bought a house, that we had a toddler, my husband left me and our kids, and has been so mean and cruel to me since I found that text. So I hope they both get food poisoning from those carnitas and poop their pants for a week. Rant over. I feel a little better now. What awful awful people.

I just logged in to make the mortgage payment for this month. My name is listed first. He had joined me in my ventures to buy a home. I had been approved without him.
So I decided to call the mortgage company and ask what would happen if he and I chose to separate. The woman put me on hold for a couple minutes and then came back to tell me that it's a special loan. All I'd have to do is send an email to special loan services and I could have him taken off.

I think it would be helpful to get them out of my head and to hear others feedback.,"we had a car together with both our names on it because his credit was too bad to have it just in his name, he said he would take care of the payments because it was supposed to be his car only. less than half a freaking year later, we got a letter saying that the payments were overdue, and they requested the entire cost of the car. i dont think he made one payment to that car. He killed my credit. he decided that he was going to go crash the car into the mailbox at the bottom of the road and get the insurance to pay it off. i begged and pleaded with him, not too, bawling my eyes out the entire time. he was set on his plan and told me to get in the car. (why he wanted me to go for this i am still unsure.) i told him i didn't want to go, that it was a terrible idea that would only make things worse, that i didn't want him to get hurt, and pleaded with him again to stay. he said that he was going to do it whether or not i agreed and that if i really loved him, i would want to go to make sure he didn't get hurt.
him:So i guess the real question is, do you really love me?
me:Well, yeah, but. . .
him:Then get in the fucking car!
it was almost like i felt my soul give up. Everything went numb. and like an idiot, i got in the car. crying the entire time.
we live in Canada, and it was the middle of winter, so the roads were terrible to begin with. 
he hit the mailbox the first time and decided it wasn't damaged enough, so he drove back up and hit it a second time before calling to report the ""accident."" i got out of the car while he was on the phone and started walking down the road, still sobbing. after he finished the false report, he got out of the car to scream at me. ""Why the hell are you crying?!"" ""Stop fucking crying!"" ""You're such a fucking baby!"" he then called the tow, and explained the damages, the guy literally told him that he just broke the thing that holds the windshield washing fluid and that the car was completely safe to drive back home.
turns out he wasn't paying his insurance either, so he couldn't even get the damage he did fixed. im pretty sure i saw the damn thing at the bottom of a cliff a few months back 🙃

6436,Is Narc Knowledge a Blessing or a Curse?,"About a year ago, I started wondering why my husband says and does the things he does.  I joined this subreddit, read two of the suggested books, and watched hours of YouTube videos. My DH has quite a few covert narc traits. We've been together for 30 years. 

On the blessing side, at least I now know what I'm dealing with and I'm not clueless anymore. I also know that my DH is nowhere near as bad as some of the ones I read about here so I feel lucky. He is rarely overtly angry, doesn't control our finances or my relationships, or devalue me verbally.  He does lie like a rug though and uses that to manipulate me into making decisions that I wouldn't have normally made if I knew the truth. He's also emotionally detached and refuses to talk about problems. He grey rocks me.  My new-found knowledge also helps me make sense of our past history. This subreddit has been a lifesaver in terms of advice and support to help me cope. 

On the  curse side, I also know that there is no ""cure"" and that narcs rarely change. Sometimes I wish I didn't know that because it doesn't leave much room for hope or incentive to fix anything. I've read that narcs get worse over time and I'm seeing that. I'm not sure if DH's actually are or if I'm just seeing that through a new lens. It would be nice to be an ostrich again.

6440,What is with men wanting a baby before they are prepared for one?,"
I 24f and my boyfriend 25m have been together for just over a year. We have already discussed how many kids we want, and have kind of discussed that we aren’t serious about starting a family yet. I have been going through some health issues over the past year, and I feel im too young to have kids yet. I’m not ready to dedicate my whole life to raising a child yet. He has always made jokes about what if I got pregnant, and what if we just had a baby. I was always okay joking around with this because, I DO want kids eventually, and if I got pregnant it wouldn’t be a problem, but again I am not ready to try for kids yet. He brought the conversation up again recently and said we should make a baby. I again, listed all the reasons that we are not ready for kids yet - like we don’t live together, we aren’t married, and we both don’t make enough to raise a family in this economy either. He knows those are all milestones I want to have before I choose to have kids. He actually ended up getting mad about this, and ended the conversation all angry. I had the same problem with my ex- whom I was together for 5 years with. Again, I expressed we were too young (I met him when I was 18, and he was 20) He also got mad at me later in the relationship because I didn’t want kids yet, but he did. He would often get upset when the baby topic was brought up, and I expressed my reasons why were weren’t ready. We ended up breaking up due to other reasons - but my question is why men are so ready to start a family with no preparation?? Like we can’t have a baby with $2000 in our savings combined. We don’t even live together (I still live with my parents due to me not working much, as I’ve been sick.) Do these guys just not understand all the work a CHILD is? And they are a life long commitment? Their needs need to come before yours always? I am not ready to do the whole daycare/ school/ after school activities thing yet. I am also the eldest daughter, and he is the youngest son. Does that have something to do with our different opinions? As I helped raise my younger brother and sister, and he was raised by his brother/ sisters? Any advice, or similar stories would be much appreciated!

6445,I think I am everything he said I was.,"Mentions of SA & r word.








It’s been almost 4 months since the break up has happened. We were together for 4 years. 

He cheated, SAed me multiple times (pressure in phone s*x, videotapes,photos, scaring me that we were going to do an*l which is something I did not like and saying that he loved it when I was scared),attempted to r*pe me and blamed me and said that I should’ve have said the safe word and not stop (I said stop 3 times and he did not stop trying to insert it until I physically got off) and we weren’t doing CNC or discussed doing so beforehand, pressured me to have s*x the first time we ever did it, and wanted me to go on vitamins so I can grow a bigger chest and eventually made me wear multiple bras at the same time during sex and called it Roleplay. As stupid that sounds, I believed him. 

I believed he was the perfect boyfriend.
A Christian, passionate about music and instruments, a nerd & geek, very intelligent, and humorous. 
He was loving, especially with gifts and his loving words were said in a delicate and loving tone. The classic “I want to marry you” and “I want to have a family with you”

I like to believe that the times we went to the beach or picnics or even study dates were purely in the intent of loving each others company but it was always s*x or s*xual stuff in the end.

When we broke up, one of my friends told him that he was a r*pist and this was his response/ text to me after NC since break up:

“I don't really know if this is the right thing to do and I feel like I've already sat on it for too long, but when i went to go see (friends name) they told me that I hurt you in a way that I don't want to say. I just want to talk about it and say that I'm sorry but I don't know if that's what you want to hear from me, especially now. It's been eating away at me and I just want to make things right.
If you think it's for the best that we don't talk about it that's fine, I just don't want you to think that I'm not gonna be held accountable for it.” 

The last line always kills me inside. 



Posting this if anyone can relate or any advice to move on. His judgments always linger in my mind and I feel like all what I endured is what I will always be.

6447,He was my everything,"I’ve spent this entire relationship focusing on him and his needs , I’ve dealt with his tantrums , and I’ve been lovebombed into forgiving him after he hurt me so many times 
- I caught him lurking on my friends OF , I forgave him 
- I told him I was suicidal , he ignored me and asked me what he should wear to the pub 
- I cried to him after I was triggered and had PTSD over a history of SA, he didn’t look up from his phone 
- I cried silently in the bathroom while he took a temper tantrum in the bedroom because he was tired and didn’t want to go to the first ultrasound for the baby I’m carrying . I’m 33 weeks 
- he kept sex tapes of him and his ex on his phone , shared them in his discord chat , boasted about what they did and how she was his best 
- throws a tantrum when I ask for comfort 
- promised me after every bad thing he would change , used his toxic relationship with his ex and BM and his trauma as an excuse and I was dumb enough to pity and believe him 
- I act as a parent while he has his daughter , love her like my own and he throws it in my face she’s not mine when I have a problem with how he speaks to her or how he treats her 
And what did he do now ? He took pictures of my family , the females , my cousins and sisters , the blond curvy ones that suit his type without their consent , and hid them in a secret folder titled “😏” that I just found that has pictures of all of his previous partners and videos of them being intimate .he took these pictures from suspicious angles at my BABY SHOWER. 
 He won’t touch me half of the time unless he wants it , my needs aren’t met . I’m the only person not in the folder .

6458,Record everything,"Hi everyone!!! This is a positive post as I (33F) am 2 years out of my abusive relationship. 

We were together for 8 years total, married for almost 1.5. I accepted his (31M) form of “love” because my own parents were toxic and abusive in their own ways, and I simply didn’t know any better. I have such an amazing support system and when I made the decision to leave (technically he forced me out but I filed a restraining order and went completely no contact), they were by side the whole way through. 

I am so grateful for my friends and family. I would not know what healthy love felt like if it were not for my best friend. 

All this to say.. I sometimes go back and listen to the voice recordings I made when my NXH (narcissistic ex husband) would yell at me during some fights. I was listening to one this morning. And he said he hopes my next one will be exactly what I deserve. And oh boy, my current partner is the kindest, gentlest man I have ever been with. 

I’m glad I made those recordings. I had them as evidence for the court proceedings for the restraining order. I also had them as a reminder as to why this was not a good match. 

If you are still in it, I know it can be scary trying to get out. But I’m so so glad I did. I am still alive and not only that, I am thriving. I have my own apartment. I am doing very well at work. 

The girl he kicked me out for ended up moving with him to Arizona. I heard she called the cops on him and got him arrested. Apparently she also robbed him. His new girl is 21 and he just gave her my old engagement ring. I’m not bothered by this. I hope she gives him hell. 

TL;DR - I listened to an old recording of my ex husband yelling at me and he said he hopes my next one is exactly what I deserve. And he was right.

-When we have to do something together and I need to get ready/do my makeup etc often he makes me hurry last minute so I can’t get ready properly and I arrive at the location always upset and in confusional state cause I just cried

6467,"I am a highly sensitive person and despite everything I feel deep empathy for him, and its making it difficult to do whats best for myself","I know his traumas, his past and I know who he is beneath it all (the person I love so dearly) but he is two different people. One of them is a wounded child and the other one is a bully that scares me. The grief of him hurting is too much for me. I feel like Im abandoning him. He has told me how lonely he has been his whole life, and I feel with that deeply because I have been lonely too. I know I have many good qualities and I will eventually meet someone else, and Im afraid he will always be alone. I dont want him to be alone, I dont want him to be lonely. I want him to be okay, and I worry he wont be.

I also confused with guilt, if its my fault that he has done the things he has done. Because he tells me it is. Im in contact now with a place who helps women out of abusive relationships and I feel like Im betraying him. Ive told him Ive reached out to them after one of his latest rage episodes, and that I need help. It didnt make him angry, it made him sad and that makes me confused and filled with guilt. 

There are so many issues in the relationship, and I know Im not perfect. Thats one of the things that also makes it hard to leave. I just try to keep reminding myself that him yelling at me and punching holes in things should never have happend in the first place, yet it has happend over and over again for four years, its become normalized to me. I keep reminding myself that one time was too many. Now we're up in hundreds of time. 

I have a hard time processing it emotionally as abusive. I know logically that it is, I know all the terms. But my emotions cant catch up.  I tell myself Im being dramatic, and attention-seeking. Yet I downplay it to everyone and keep it a secret. Going to get help makes this whole thing very real, it makes me a woman in an abusive relationship and I have a hard time believing that myself. Its like Im having two different conversations with myself constantly. One of them is angry and wants to protect me. They know I deserve something soft, reliable and calm. They know I cant end up in something so close to my abusive childhood. They know its not right.

6482,I love everything about him except the way he treats me,"He’s kind to strangers- he will stop to help people stranded on the side of the road. If he passes a homeless person when going to order lunch, he buys an extra meal for them.


He’s generous to family and friends- he gives money and expects nothing in return. He has helped friends get jobs, loaned out his car, supported their businesses. 


He’s good to (other people’s) kids. He calls his nieces princesses and dotes on them with pure adoration. His nephew can do no wrong.


He is respectful, funny, and smart. He is perfect.


But not to me. He is cruel and merciless.


I used to blame myself but then I realized: he pours all his negativity into me so he can be so good. 


He is controlling of my money so he can be free with his. He criticizes everything I do or don’t do so he has grace to give to others. He is strict with our kids so he can be the fun uncle.


Let me be clear: this is not acceptable. I just had a revelation that he is always the same abusive person. He just uses up all his anger and negativity at home so that everyone else sees the good parts of him. It’s like he’s a dirty coin and I’m the rag used to clean it so it looks shiny to other people.

6485,"Friends still hangout with my abusive ex, even though they know everything.","I finally broke free from my ex after 2.5 years of emotional abuse and manipulation. It’s been 6 months since the breakup and I feel like he has just as much control over my life as he always has. He insists he wants to hang as friends, and when I don’t agree to hang he abuses me, calling me names and making personal attacks, and makes weird, vague threats. Things like “I’ve got something up my sleeve for when you least expect it, just you wait”

I’ve ended up having to block him off everything, phone number, all social media, email etc. He still manages to find ways to get in contact, whether it be using an old WhatsApp account or ringing off an unknown number. He says things like “I’m only so nasty because I love you so much and I’m so sad I lost you”.

My close friend who introduced me to him has been in the loop throughout the whole breakup and was completely aware of how he treated me when we were together. I know she’s told our other friends, because people say things like “I’m so sorry he was like that to you. Nobody deserves that”.

My problem is, they’re all still friends with him. He knew them all first, and is very charming and good at hiding how awful he truly is. But they all know what he’s like behind closed doors, and say things like “he’s unwell. He needs help.” When I told my close friend that it hurt me that she was still friends with him, her response was “I’m sorry he’s been this way but he’s been my friend for a long time and I’m not going to drop him because of how he treated you.”

6486,i still compare everything with my past abusive relationship,"almost exactly a year ago, i finally got out of an abusive relationship. he was my first serious relationship, we moved in together, at some point his child from another woman moved in with us (she was 3, i was 19 and he was 23). he had some serious mental issues, he always threatened to kill himself if i would leave him, abused me mentally and sexually and regularly physically assaulted me. i stayed with him for almost 4 years, mainly because i cared the most for his daughter. in the end, i got pregnant (i did use contraception and didn‘t want that to happen) and he basically forced me to have an abortion. he never offered any help with that and kicked me out in a day. 
like i said, it‘s been a year and i‘m still processing but since the beginning of the year i‘ve grown a lot and started to let finally go of the mindset he put me in. i‘ve dated two other guys for about two months each, but i couldn‘t get emotionally invested with them and didn‘t feel a connection, so i ended things. the last time i dated was in february. since then, i kind of gave up the dating game and focused more on myself. but two months ago i met another man and it immediately clicked. we started about a month after getting to know each other and since then, we‘ve been seeing each other quite often. he‘s the first person i can trust again and i guess i‘m finally learning to fall in love again. 
the only thing that keeps me from being happy is that i find myself still comparing my new partner with my abusive ex. for example, i always had to cook dinner for my ex, if i didn‘t he would get angry and eventually assault me. a few days ago, my new partner came over and dinner wasn‘t quite ready, i panicked and when he arrived we both were confused of each others reaction because it was no big deal for him. idk if this even makes sense, but i just want to let go of these ideals and expectations i still have, because i know they‘re no good.",no,no,yes,yes,yes,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred

I wish everyone knew this was a part of me. I wish everyone knew that this hurts, it hurts to be alive knowing he is out there, existing. I feel so lonely, so stupid and quiet and small, aching for a body that isn’t mine anymore. There was a time when I would have died for him. Sat in the front seat of his car and begged him to hit me, begged him to kill me so I would feel forgiven. There’s never been a way out of this; I’m useless, trying to lose myself in person after person after person. He was right when he said I was always the monster, always the bad guy.

1. Didn't want me to eat red meat. Of any kind. His excuse was that we can't trust anyone who gives us meat that is even a bit pinkish. It had to be fully cooked, otherwise we would get sick. If I ate some, he would refuse to kiss me or touch my hands for days and would be angry at me for not listening to him. Same went for raw fish, snails, frog legs, clams... ""Don't you trust me? What if you fell sick and died! Then I'd feel so bad!"" He would say.


2. I couldn't go out by myself. He would say that the changes of me getting sexually assaulted or raped were about 20% every time I went out by myself. ""I looked it up"", he said. If I did go out by myself, he wanted me to text him every 15 minutes to make sure I was okay. If I forgot, we would call me crying, telling me how inconsiderate I was of him.

3. I couldn't take the bus or any public transportation by myself. Same reason as number 2

4. I couldn't dress how I want. ""That dress shows way too much of your legs, boys are gonna look at you. Don't be surprised if you get groped.""

5. Couldn't spend time by myself. Ever. He would always think I was angry at him, even if I told him I wasn't. ""Why would you need to spend time by yourself? Are you mad at me? What did I do? We can spend time alone together, we don't have to talk or do anything!""


6. Couldn't spend time with my friends and family.

Drop everything of my new life and just end this court case. I am terrified because he nearly killed me last time. I wouldn't go back. That's what it took for me to leave. 

Over 7 years I spent with him. 7 years of my life. I thought it would get better. I wanted marriage and kids. You wouldn't hit your wife, or the mother of your children. It would be different. I would be safe.  He would understand. Luckily we did not marry or have kids.

 Friday is the last announcement. He will plead guilty or it will be taken to trial. I can't imagine feeling this way before every trial date. I am not strong enough. The DA took my case, they're handling everything. I can't cope. I am drinking more and more. I have nightmares every night. Sometimes I wake up screaming. I am terrified of him. Waiting for him to come after me. I am scared. Every shadow, every sound, every sudden movement, anything that's out of the ordinary. It's him. He's coming. He's after me. I can't escape Having him in front of me so I can watch would be easier right? Until the abuse starts again. 

He never apologized. He did what he did as punishment.  I messed up. It was my fault. It was wrong I know but financially I was trapped. We had one car in both our names. We shared an apartment lease. We shared 3 cats and 1 dog. We worked at the same place. I was cut off from my friends. I need a friend. I am alone. Making friends after is really hard I don't know where to start. 

I need this to be over. I want him to plead guilty. He needs to admit he did what he did. I want the whole court room to know he did what I have proof of (ER, police and photos). I want him to acknowledge my pain. Any ""I'm sorry"" won't mean anything. It will be his lawyer talking.

I am spiraling. I am drinking. Coping mechanisms don't work. I feel like I am drowning. I am very depressed. PTSD to the max. Nightmares if I sleep that night. I have an incredible man that is supportive and this relationship is so healthy I feel like it's weird. It feels too good to be true.

My ex told me that nobody else would want me and that nobody would believe me and that he would ruin me. He would call me names constantly and hit me and take my phone and my money. He tried telling me that if I left him I could not take our son with me even though he doesn't have any rights and he told me that if I try it I would not make it out of his yard.

I never thought that I would relate to what she went through. I've been out for two months now and I'm still dealing with people who are telling me that it was my fault for saying and to stop talking about it because it's in the past and I just stay away from those kinds of people.

No one understands the psychological torture that you go through until they go through it themselves. I would never wish that on my worst enemy. The good part is that I'm out now and starting on my healing journey. No longer will I have to deal with what he did to me ever again. My life is my own again, he can't control me.

I hate them… but I hate myself more for not leaving after the first few red flags. Maybe unconsciously I stayed BECAUSE I hate myself. I know what I HAVE to do or SHOULD do to help myself heal.

6512,I have lost everything and gained everything.,"I have lost my home, most of belongings, the city and state I lived in, forced to give up my beautiful pets for adoption and I have wasted a year of my life believing my circumstances were different - that he wasn’t really an abuser/ it was a one off/ he’ll change/ it won’t be like other cases. I worked in DV for years and the self shame I feel for finding myself trapped in the situation for as long as I did makes me sick. The grieving process is hellish and with time and space I realise just how much he brainwashed me. The verbal abuse escalated to a physical incident. I believed it was a one off. He treated me better for a while. Then suddenly I didn’t know how I was deep into the cycle of physical and mental abuse. I am now in court proceedings. I have lost almost everything but I am alive and I will get through this. My heart is broken. I am physically and mentally suffering. Sometimes my confused brain still convinces itself I still love and miss/ need him. 2 suitcases to my name, a protection order and on the other side of the country with no job, car or idea of what my future looks like. but whatever it is it is better than living in fear, feeling worthless, begging for love, kindness, respect, fidelity and emotional and physical safety. I would give anything to go back to the first incident and RUN. ANYTHING. The regrets are heavy. I am scared of the court process but I will stop him from hurting someone else.

6513,When he tried to take everything away from me,"Best lesson I've learned today was detaching myself from objects and people. I grew up in a home where our parents were absent and our basic needs were unmet. It came to the point where my siblings and I had to fend for and raise ourselves in a boarding home full of gang members and other strangers. I was finally able to make it to the other side by not letting our lack stop me from obtaining my degree, going to the military, then working in a career I absolutely love. But living in lack as a child affected me in that I became materialistic as an adult. 


However, the experience of getting my items stolen by the ex helped me realize that they were all just objects that has nothing to do with my identity and defining life's meaning or purpose. All that is valuable is within yourself because we are all divine and that is something we can take with us on the other side. 


When I came home this morning, I found that the ex has taken every last chance to destroy me by stealing all the appliances including the refrigerator and washer and dryer. He's also stolen both televisions and furniture that I've purchased with my hard-earned money. And to top it off, he stole all the major yard tools and the bed. But as I was sitting down on the living couch in the middle of a barren house, I started to see the positivity in this experience; one day you can have it all, and one day you can have it all taken away, and this is why it is best to know your own value and not attach yourself to outside physical objects. This realization brought a feeling of peace in my heart to move on and let go knowing that I still have love surrounding me and I still have my light to shine.",cannot be inferred,no,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes

He’s seen everything.
He says if I call the cops he will tell them all about me. 
I called my parents. They’re aware of the situation in full. I don’t know what happens now but wanted to update so there’s some trail if something happens.


I’d previously posted in another subreddit because I needed to leave him but he wouldn’t let me take the kids.

The isolation, the monitoring of my location constantly, watching me on hidden cameras,  and monitoring of my texts is exhausting.

It keeps escalating. He’s wanting to purchase an AR and tactical gear “for protection”, but he knows I’m terrified of this.

I’d gotten a lot of great ideas on my last post and had planned to leave with the kids when he went to work. Had a go bag and everything.

It’s like he KNEW and up and quit his job. He’s here 24/7. I don’t know how to leave because he is always watching me. I don’t want a big scene or to escalate to where the kids or myself get hurt. He is acting SUPER nice and it’s very odd. 

I guess I’m just going to play it cool until he goes out for something, whenever that is. Then I can leave and go to my parents for safety.

 This worked somewhat in that i put on a mask and went about my day but this year it started to slip and the emotions all came flooding though.

Guess what I don’t have after leaving him! I still have some anxiety, but it’s very mild. And I rarely have stomach issues anymore. But everything else is gone! What’s even more messed up is that it all crept up on me so slowly that it never occurred to me that he could be the cause of my issues. After all, like many of us, I believed he loved me.

He isolates me from the world. I cant leave the house. He puts nanny cams on me. Its been 3 years and i have no family and no friends. And yes actually none. 

Sex is just R all the time. In the morning he will force himselve upon me and i lie there and pretend to sleep until its over. I dread the time of the day when he wants to do it. I basically live with friction burn all the time. 

Constanly accused of cheating. Incessantly. I dont even leave the house. Or have any friends. I cant even drive. He checks my phone every waking moment of the day. Yet somehow im still cheating in his eyes.

So i let him come back and the cycle began again. I feel like i am dying and there is no escape and like im not strong enough to leave. I am so unhappy and hopeless. I bleieve i am ugly and unlikeable and incapable of making friends or finding anyone else.

He has succeeded with the smear campaign, he threatens me with a custody battle whenever he gets angry. Which scares me A LOT because he has a lot of money and is extremely charming and manipulative. He gets away with most things he wants so why would a custody battle be any different?

On top of everything our 2 year old only wants daddy now. I know it’s normal for toddlers to have favorites but the irony of it all really saddens me. After many months of planning in secret, I fled the NEX so I could protect our daughter from him at least 50% of the time, when she is with me. To give her a peaceful home environment. But she still prefers him and it plays right into his hands because it proves what a ”wonderful” father he is and I am ”lying” about him being abusive to me. It also makes me feel that he really is getting away with everything. 

I am also scared that he will always blatantly be the favorite parent and that he will be able to give her things that I can’t give her. Expensive trips, a big house, fancy toys etc. I have really dark and scary thoughts about the future and imagine that he somehow will be able to turn her against me. 

I will probably start some sort of therapy to help me cope. I also want to start journaling. I just don’t have the strength right now.

6548,For those who need a glimmer of hope. It gets better!,"So I was married to a narc for 7 years before I finally left. He is still a narc, and he proved it in full display today. 

We have been in and out of court and mediation since the divorce closing loopholes, and amending things, trying to force him to do what he should. Several months ago, my youngest child came home with a belt bruise across his behind, then I found out he has given our children alcohol(everything from beer to moonshine). So my attorney filed the appropriate motion(contempt to be exact) and got us a hearing. 

During said hearing, nex admitted (after being given his 5th amendment rights) to excessively physically disciplining the kids and giving them alcohol. So I filed criminal charges, which resulted in his arrest (which I got to see in open court).

Ofcourse he bailed out near immediately (his mugshot is now his called ID on my phone lol), but his first call hearing was today. Want to know what his narcissistic self did?? 

He told the judge his arrest was illegal, that he was never read his rights (because of course this couldn't be his own fault), told the judge he had no jurisdiction over it, and then told him (yes TOLD HIM) to throw it out. 😐 

There is a hearing set for January 😂

I share this as a small beacon of hope for those right in the middle of leaving a narc. Sometimes they DO get what's coming to them. They will always, eventually, make a mistake. As a reminder, you cannot MAKE them do anything and not to stress yourself trying. 💜 also, you can have a giggle with me ✌🏻

First thing his deadbeat opens up in rebuttal (no attorney) is about child support and retroactive child support. I make more. He disappeared for 2 years comes back court awards him 50/50. He is never there. He only wants it for the $.  Makes his older son watch her. Court doesn't care...

Now they send us back to mediation and co-parenting counseling. After 8 months of court and 2x at mediation we cannot resolve issues. Not without my lack of trying(had facts). What do I have to look out for and if anyone has experience with this? I tried to find someone who knows about narcissistic behaviors, but its hard.

It is in our temporary order that even though he has primary my Nex has to contact me and discuss things. I had not heard from him so I contacted my lawyer to ask if she could reach out to his lawyer and find out what was going on. 

He finally reached out and claimed he had been waiting until this weekend to make sure he knew the facts and we should discuss it. He asked how I felt and if I had concerns. 

I voiced my concerns in my email. Then I got nothing back from him and there were only 32 hours left until the deadline and I wanted him to address my concerns. So I emailed him again asking him if he would please respond. He did. 

In his response he attacked my parents, who I live with, for staying up late. He ridiculed me for oversleeping when we were together and the kids being late to school. How it was my fault and I embarrassed them. He said he would happily show the guardian ad litem the print outs from the school of how often we were late. He claims as the working part of our family he had the right to not take them to school. Really he was up all night playing video games. He told me my daughter should not be sleeping with me. (She asks to and I enjoy her snuggles) His message goes on to make snide remarks about her lack of friends in my neighborhood. (The house he lives in we lived in for 5 years before I left. Her and I made friends in the neighborhood). He quoted the CDC and medical journals at me rather than it be two parents talking about their child. 

I tried to advocate for her being in virtual in her own school instead of the county wide program and he shot that down as I only care about myself. So I offered up a statewide program and he attacked that saying I was now swapping my position. He has an answer for everything. 

He makes me so frustrated. I never know which way is up. I can’t have an opinion unless it is the same as his and any discord is met with nothing but attacks on how bad of a parent or person I am. 

I cried far more tears today than he deserves out of me. I let him make me feel so small. 

But then I remembered. I don’t have to crawl in bed with him tonight and “service” him. I don’t have to listen to his mouth. I am afraid of what he will lie and tell whomever. But I know I tried my best for my girl. And her mama is so much better off without him.

6551,Narcopath has now got doctor on side,"So it turns out (of course) that nex has been complaining about me to the family doctor for years, in case I should one day attempt to blow the whistle on his abuse of me and the kids. 

Five months ago, that day came, we left home and since then I’ve been through the usual hell they launch - smears, attempts to put me in jail etc. 

Child welfare and police have received 4 witness accounts, my kids have told them stuff, I’ve told them everything - but they are sweeping it all under the carpet because nex is powerful in the community and has retained the country’s best law firm. 

As part of all this, nex has tried to accuse me of various mental and physical ailments that he claims make me unfit to parent - and also make my “allegations” “not credible.”

I found out about this plan and shut them down one by one before they got very far. But one common physical ailment I do have requires medication. In the side effects it lists about 100 things that I don’t have.

Nevertheless, today family doctor called twice and told me my “allegations” were false and I’m suffering from paranoia as a result of the meds. Initially I was just flabbergasted that the doctor (who barely knows me) would be so unprofessional. He has connections to my husbands family and I couldn’t believe it was really happening. 

He called back and wants me to go in regularly to be “monitored” for my “symptoms”. If I disagree with anything presumably I can be labelled ‘difficult’ and ‘paranoid’ as per how nex has set the scene with the doctor. 

Is this how psycho nex and his family get me committed? Or is it just about manufacturing evidence and ruining my medical records for court? 

Most importantly, wtf can I do? I’m wary of changing doctor because that will probably be used against me. I’m also desperately trying to keep the house and stay with the same school - and so I’m using “ties to the community” including this doctor as a reason.

So to preface everything regarding our friends, My BF and I have both a few mutual friends and personal friends. His friends are mostly dudes he met at college and while we are on friendly terms they are his friends. I have a similar group of friends. The close friend from my previous post is a member of this group. 

So onto the update, the girl, let's call her Grace, called me up about an hour ago and told me some interesting news. So she’s dating one of the guys from my Bf’s inner circle and they were talking about this drama and the guy says something like “I can’t believe OP suddenly sprung wanting to keep her last name on BF after they got engaged. If it was important to her she should have brought it up sooner and not gotten emotional when BF refused to agree with her.” Grace and my other friends are very aware of my stance and know I make a point of stating this fact early on so she was confused by what was going on. She decided not to confront her boyfriend and so after her boyfriend left she called me up. 

She was polite but blunt when asking if my BF knew about my stance on my last name. I told her adamantly that he did and even sent screenshots of texts where we discussed my last name and if the kids were going to take my name. It’s moments like this I’m glad I save my texts for sentimental reasons since it saved my ass today. I asked if she could learn anything else from her boyfriend since I’m concerned with what is going on. It’s one thing to change your mind, it's another thing entirely to lie about never knowing this.

So I have no idea where this is coming from since I wasn't aware his friend group didn't know. Granted I never spoke to any of them about it since we aren't really friends and the topic never came up but I figured he'd at least mention it. I don't understand what is going on and I have no idea where to go from here. I was going to give him space but now i want to call and demand answers.

6566,Unexpected Breakup: WTF Happened? 35F and 35M,"I f35 started dating m35 almost 5mo ago. Everything seemed to be aligning: effortless connection, just went on a mini vaca to meet and stay with his parents, and earlier this week he told me he felt like we’ve had healthy relationship growth and he was ready to meet my daughter. Recently he’s mentioned how good it feels to not feel a sense of obligation but to feel desire to be with me. He said it’s easy to like me because he can be himself and enjoys the space I give him. Self admittedly, he has a hard time connecting with women so I felt reassurance from him expressing stuff like that.

This past Friday he left a job due to layoff that he’s been at for over a decade and was having a hard time emotionally processing it, though he’s known about it since last year. Thankfully, he’s got a great job already lined up to start next week, which he’s also very nervous about. All very understandable. The Wednesday before the layoff, I was at his place and he mentioned an out of state company reaching out to him. He casually spoke about moving if necessary but never once seemed to be concerned about “us” so I mentioned my selfish indifference. He didn’t feel like the job was viable because they weren’t wanting to pay what he asked anyway.

After a night to think about it, I told him his nonchalance about his willingness to move made me apprehensive to introduce him to my daughter until he knows what he wants. I’ve never introduced her to a boyfriend before so it’s a big deal for me to ensure it’s stable. He said he understood and agreed but then hours later said he no longer felt good about us. He said Wednesday night he didn’t actually want me to come over because he was tired and didn’t want to entertain and the night felt off. I don’t think that’s weird since we both enjoy our own time to recharge but he could’ve just said that to begin with. He said he couldn’t explain how he felt but that it wasn’t good and maybe it was from dealing with the stress of the jobs creating a big life change. I mean, I don’t even understand how we were beginning to discuss breaking up because there was never an argument or in depth conversation. He said he was overwhelmed and didn’t have a clear mind to be able to make a decision on our fate and needed a few days. We literally went from honeymoon bliss to “I don’t feel good about us” overnight.

6571,Why is it so hard to leave?,"We’ve been married for 6 years in May. We were young and I have accepted that we both were not ready. However here we sit with two kids, a third on the way and his antics have escalated to paying for sexual intercourse (we’re in Germany). I just found out through his Signal chat. Everything has still hurt but has been slowly progressing to him physically cheating. I always said I would never stay if he physically cheated but I have believed he would stop and always gave him the benefit of the doubt. I always get a “feeling” and he constantly reassures me but falls short when the evidence comes to light. 

The conflict? I battle with myself as a Christian woman and the fact that he is the best father and provider I could ever imagine. He is everything I have ever prayed for. He is my best friend and I don’t think anyone else will put up with me or treat my children how they deserve. When do I get to feel good enough? Why does this only happen when I am pregnant and at my most vulnerable? 

I am college educated and make enough money to be on my own (a lesson from my mother and cheating father.) How do I work through this? What do I need to do? I get that I have been emotionally reserved because of our passed and trying to work through the hurt but every time I let my guard down it happens again. We aren’t intimate as much as I would like because well pregnancy is awful…

6584,I'm starting to like someone else after my N-ex.,"Long story short: I was 19 when I met my N-ex fiancé (he was 26). He lovedbombed and proposed 6 months later. We lasted nearly 5 years, until last December. We just started to live together, but never married despite being engaged for so long. He cheated, discarded me, kicked me out of our home and toyed with me for sex 2 times after the breakup. He wanted me to believe he still loved me but needed time, that he wanted to come back to me at some point. He said he didn't want me to wait, yet did everything (breadcrumbs, etc) to keep me around. I ended up blocking him everywhere and for what I saw (I bumped into him the other day) he is now dating another ~19yo, now he being 31. 

He broke me in so many ways I didn't think I could survive it. My heart ache was so big I couldn't be awake. The nightmares so real I couldn't sleep either. I thought I would never be able to love or like anyone again.

It's been 9 months. I'm single and in therapy since 8 months ago. I feel like healing. And this week I started my classes again (after having to quit last year because of migraines my ex was causing me with the abuse and neglect and the cheating) and reconnected with a guy I've been friends with for 2 years. He is a couple years younger, we are in the same class and we get along really well. This few days we have been stucked together like glue and I felt so good around him again that I thought ""I may crush on him at some point"". He is really handsome and a good guy overall. I'm not saying I'm crushing now because it's been a few days, but I felt like *I could* with some more time. Which made me feel so good with myself because there is no more chains on me anymore. I can like other people, after thinking for so long that he ruined my ability to love. That I would never be able to start another ""something"" with someone because I was broken. That he broke me.


I was not broken. Just hurt. And I'm finally moving on. I feel free from his shadow and chains. I feel like I can live on my own again, not being afraid of liking someone anymore. I'm enjoying those sparks I felt yesterday when I spent hours with this new guy and see wherever this goes as long as I feel comfortable and things feel right.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
6586,Called the police and the suggestion is I move out,"I previously posted about how I finally found the courage to call a domestic violence agency. Big shocker, I never heard from them again. Yesterday around 5pm, my abuser was insanely drunk and went crazy again threatening me. I called the police who showed up quickly, but were also not much help. Their suggestion was I leave (which I did). As they were in the apartment with me so I could pack some belongings to go to my parents (yet again!) he was making threats to me, in front of them. When I was reading the DIR, all that was stated is how I called and reported him being intoxicated. Everything else I had told them about his threats, about the threats he made in front of them (telling the police I need to watch my back, that I fucked up, that he’s going to get me), the broken property…none of listed. Their suggestion to me? “It’s easier if you just move.”

It’s easier if *I* just move???? It’s easier for *me* to just move…from an apartment where I am the lease holder…while 33 weeks pregnant, schedule for an induction in a month…with a 5 year old in school???? And that’s the easiest way out of this??? To make everything worse, I’m sitting here paying for an apartment, while he’s sending me text messages taunting me how how he “won,” I’m a “punk ass” and the “cop thing backfired” because I was the one who left, while he’s sitting there “enjoying (his) drink on the couch.”

This can’t be actually happening!! As much as I didn’t want to petition for an order of protection, it might be all I can do. But is it even worth it??? Or will the same “suggestion” come up from the courts that’s it’s easier for the heavily pregnant woman with the young child to simply find a new apartment, break a lease, and move in a month???",yes,yes,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,yes,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,yes
6591,"Is it common for a narcissist to make you
feel like you are a narcissist?","
My husband is a narcissist and I am so drained from all the abuse l've endured. He keeps trying to embed in my head that I am in fact a covert narcissist. I have been researching narcissistic behavior and
some of the traits the covert narcissist has kinda makes me look like one. I have been so confused because I don't have anything in me to hurt people. If I'm giving to everyone it's because I want to, not to manipulate people, I get really sad and might need validation sometimes because people often take my
kindness for weakness. He said I'm hypersensitive to everything and I always play victim but that's not true. I get discouraged because the things he says to me are very degrading and then he tries to down play
them as jokes. He'll see me happy and then call me a name or say something to ruin my day.

abusive experiences with him, but has anyone ever experienced a covert narcissist molding or grooming you into being a covert narcissist?

He's refusing to do anything. He will not lift a finger because I'm the one that wants the divorce and then when I called him on it, he said it's because he works too much. He was home all last night but he couldn't even clean his bedroom.... And because normally all he does is curse me out all night I've blocked him on my phones. So today, even though all I'm talking about is the divorce and getting the house ready and his current behavior he keeps saying ""keep it about the divorce"" ""I've already blocked both of your phones, if you keep it up I'll block you on here too"". 

It's insane. And we had to go with his real estate agent that his parents use so he could feel he can control things.... I'm leaving the bedroom so the agent can see what a pig he is...

6596,Husband Narc Obliterated 9 Year Anniversary...can't figure out why...,"I spent so long preparing and planning the perfect anniversary and everything was going absolutely perfect...until our Anniversary dinner...which I ended up casually walking out of because of the things he was saying. And we know Narcs, they don't say things for YOU to hear- they say them so OTHERS hear. 

He was diagnosing me with mental illnesses, saying I have no friends or family, I think I blacked out at that point. I just picked up my purse as if I was headed to the bathroom and left. He MUST have known what he was doing was wrong, because we were staying at a huge resort. And though I left first, he somehow got our food packed up, paid the bill, and made it to the hotel room before me!! 

The next morning, I got up early and got dressed and went to sit at a table with a view...he asked me where I was going and I said, ""I don't know"". 

I don't even know how he found me in this place! I was in a nook in a hallway!!! I had ordered a mimosa. Suddenly the rest of the trip was about what an alcoholic I am and he's divorcing me. He hasn't spoken to me in days now. 

He is what I've learned to call a 'dry drunk'. He was disciplined at work for being intoxicated and he has to be drug and alcohol free for 5 years. He's 4 years into it. I always ask him if it is ok if I have a cocktail or a drink and he has always insisted that it is fine and it doesn't affect him. I don't know what switch flipped in his brain; whether I walked out for the first time while he was publicly berating me or if it was that I had a mimosa. 

But at the airport on the way home, he insisted on causing a scene by tossing money into my face and leaving lunch. I have no idea how to deal with this anymore.

6599,I'm so dumb.....,"So I see it. I didn't for a long time. I honestly thought it was just his drinking problem and if he just quit drinking things would be good. But last summer he cheated. He had a whole affair with a 60 year old woman. He gave me an STD, which thankfully could be cured. Unfortunately it made me have a miscarriage. I tried. I tried to forgive him. I was a broken mess sitting on the couch. He kept running to the bathroom to text some other girl about a beach excursion that they were supposed to have the next day. 

He could look at me, a broken f****** mess, and still run off and texts other girl all kinds of sexual s***. I'm sitting at the courthouse right now to file the paperwork and I can't do it. It makes me so sad. I see all the potential and what could have been. And I know it's what's not. But it's still makes me so sad. 

Honestly, reading all of your stories makes me feel so much stronger. So tell me, tell me how hard it was to leave. Tell me how broken your heart was to go. Tell me how much better your life is now. That there's something on the other side. That you don't regret it. 

I'm so scared financially. Honestly I think maybe that's the hardest part. I have bad credit. I live in New Jersey which is one of the most expensive States. I have three dogs two cats and a kid.... But I can't stay. And I know that. I'm thinking about moving to Virginia by my sister where it's significantly cheaper. I'm going to get in between 40 to 60 Grand from the sale of the house. I feel responsibility for the pets and I don't want to separate them and send them to different houses. And I think that's what overwhelms me the most. If it was just me and the kid, I'd be able to run a place anywhere after we sell the house. Start over brand new somewhere else. I know that. But I take care of everything and I feel guilty....

I thought that I was helping her through everything but turns out she was manipulating my kindness and using me. She never let me see my friends, she had to check my phone, and I had to tell her everything. 
Finally we broke up eight months later. And she decides to tell our entire school false things about me like I was racist and I tried to do things to her.

I came inside when I knew he had Left. I didn’t think to look around the house but now after 2 hours (how long he is usually at gym) I’ve texted him asking if he’s okay and apologising if I’m asleep when he’s back. 

Now he’s told me he’s actually left for good and not coming back and getting so angry at me for not noticing. He took his laptop and phone charger. I didn’t look in our bedroom as I went straight to the couch and didn’t think I had to since he said he was going to gym. 
He told me I should have noticed and that I never see him or notice him. I know these are usually one sided and I know I can definitely make more of an effort but everything I do revolves around him he is the centre of my universe to and unhealthy extent. I notice if he eats at a different time of day than usual ffs. 

Now I’m begging for him to come, it’s been 4 hours of him not telling me where he is or if he’s safe and just telling me I’ll never give him the love he deserves. I know he has nowhere to go we just moved to a new country. He’s walking around the streets. I’ve told him I’ll sleep on the couch it’s his home and please just come home and be safe but still he refuses and ignores me.

On top of that, I'm feeling a bit under the weather because I had to give up my passion 5 years ago, and when I wanted to size an opportunity people told me I wasn't good enough.

We also been trying to buy a house with no success lately, but friends have managed to buy and move to their new place. And I feel a bit stuck.

I don't have many friends and I usually keep things for myself. Partner (43) saw that I was a bit in my head this morning and ask me what's was up. I usually don't share too much because they will try to suggest ideas and solutions when I don't even know what I'm feeling and I just need to verbalize it.

I was talking and trying to share, saying I was feeling very sad and lost  when they interrupt me and tried to find solutions. I said it's ok, I just need active listening not solutions.

And then they snapped at me. They started being frustrated about how it wasn't a conversation and I was blaming them for not listening and I didn't need them anyway. 

 I tried to explain that I didn't even know what I was feeling and I was just trying to put my ideas together and it was about them, just life in general.

They  then starting yelling at me about how It's not a conversation and I said I was already not feeling good and there no need for yelling. I was already in a weak mental space and I just wanted to talk.

They said I was just trying to blame everything on them. I need to take a meeting as it was the beginning of my work day and they started stumping around

He cried when we were not placed in the same group for a project. He cried when i got a job and he did not. He cried when we ordered  food and it ran late. He cries watching movies. He cries  listening  to songs.

I've gently suggested  him to try get a therapist  and he cried  because  he felt i insinuated that's  he's  crazy or something. 

One time i had some  problems with my friends  and just wanted to rant 🙃. He cried hearing the story.  

Sometimes when we are on video call at night, he would  randomly  cry and say how he feels like the world is too unfair to him.

At this point, i have not really  seen any emotion in him other than crying. I'm always  walking ok eggshells around him because  i don't  wanna make him cry.

She deleted the app already since she's already dating someone but turns out my bf followed her on ig a week ago. She sent me screenshots of the follow (I myself can confirm it's true) but apologized for not having screenshots of the Bumble match since she only recently found out he had a girlfriend (after she already deleted the app).

6617,"Husband Mocked Me with Coworker, Need Advice on Moving Forward","I think my previous post was deleted for language.

Hello Reddit community,

I 37f recently discovered some deeply disturbing messages between my husband 47m and a female coworker 35f that have left me feeling heartbroken and betrayed.

The Discovery: I found text messages where my husband was talking negatively about my body and private parts to this coworker. They were laughing and making fun of me, even mocking the sexual fantasies that I had shared with my husband in confidence.

The Impact: Naturally, this revelation has shattered my trust in my husband. I feel humiliated, disrespected, and hurt beyond words. It's been difficult for me to come to terms with the fact that someone I loved and trusted could betray me in such a cruel way.

Intimacy Issues: Unsurprisingly, this discovery has greatly impacted our intimacy. My husband is now upset that I am struggling to be intimate with him after finding out about his hurtful actions. He doesn't seem to understand the depth of the damage he has caused or how his betrayal has affected our relationship.

I'm at a loss for what to do next. Has anyone else been through something similar? How did you cope with such a breach of trust? Any advice on how to navigate these feelings of betrayal and move forward would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and for any support or guidance you can offer during this difficult time.

TLDR: I discovered my husband was mocking my body and private parts with a female coworker, feeling betrayed and unsure how to move forward. Asking for advice on coping with the breach of trust and navigating feelings of betrayal.

6627,The worst choice ever.,"So there was a period of time in my life where I wasn’t the most trustworthy or reliable person, let alone lover. I also used to use meth and that made it even easier to stay selfish/self-centered and confident at the same time. 
I had been living with my partner at the time he was 22 and I was 26. I was living in his house and had no legal claim to anything in the house either. He also paid for everything… I mean everything it was the most codependent I have ever been. Our dynamic was definitely 98%-2%. So as you can tell there was alot of potential for things to go wrong especially with my entitlement. 
I cheated on him, profusely. Like at least 20 times before I was confronted about it. I also had just recently lost my job due to my drug addiction and job negligence, and because of that he gave me an ultimatum; I could either leave (leave the house and his life and be homeless) or I could stay and ‘support’ our family the only way I know how..
I chose the latter. i.e. the worst decision I have ever made. 
He meant that if I were to stay I had to be at his beck and call sexually and it was never nice, loving, or pleasant. He was forceful and cruel and there were a couple times I was raped by him. However since I agreed to the deal I’m not really sure what it was. This abuse lasted for a while before more and more physical altercations escalated to the point of us no longer being allowed to see each other or communicate. 
Best part is, I ended up homeless anyway. Now I’m left with this massive amount of trauma to comb through. But, the question I have for you and I can sense the proper answer but I need real feedback from other survivors; did I deserve it? Especially because I chose it. 
For clarification please ask for more details if you need more information.

6630,Do emotional abusers know that they are emotionally abusive? Are they bad people?,"My ex and I were together for 11 years. I don’t know when the emotional abuse started or if it was the entire relationship. We started dating when we were 16 so it’s hard to tell. The last several years were definitely emotionally abusive. But it wasn’t all bad. I know that he loved me so much, we had a lot of great memories, and I had a lot of good times with him. Even during the emotionally abusive parts. Does that make him a bad person? Does an emotional abuser know that they are being emotionally abusive?

I used to get so frustrated and feel sooo crazy and unseen and feel like I couldn’t trust my own judgement and that I was speaking a different language to him and I used to get physical with him. I’d throw things, throw things at him, shove him, hit him. Does this make me physically abusive? Does this make me a bad person? (These are genuine questions btw. I’m in therapy and I’m constantly working on healing and taking control over my emotions. It’s just really hard for me to understand what is real and what is not) 

 I always said he was a good person. I’m not sure if now that the dust has settled, I’m finally seeing how abused I was and that’s terrifying. I’m not sure if my physical aggression allows for the emotional aggression and vice versa. I don’t know how to tell what is objectively true and I feel like I have no sense to subjectively distinguish what I’ve experienced and I feel like I’m CRAZY!! It is so fucking exhausting and scary.

Right now things are okay.. i know the holidays are coming to an end and i know a blow up is coming in the near future.

I saw signs before we got married but i thought i could fix them.. I was wrong. We’ve been married for less than 6 months and he has already told me how horrible of a wife i have been. Along with many other forms of emotional, verbal, sexual, even a little physical abuse. Even though he has never hit me or choked me, he has gotten in my face, yelling and screaming, and throwing things, slight pushes. Since he has never hit me, it feels like i can’t leave.. 

he said to me “one day, you’re going to come home and i’m going to have a bullet in my head and i’m going to be happy with the fact that you have to live with me being dead bc of you. I wish death upon myself bc of you.” 

I’m scared to leave bc i feel guilty. We are in a decent place right now, but deep down i know it won’t last long. I feel like i have to wait until another blow up happens in order for me to leave. I’ve talked to my parents/friends and they said they’re scared for me and are ready to help me leave whenever i am ready to do so. 

I know he loves me but his words and actions have made me feel so bad about myself. He’s kissing my ass right now and being nice. I know this is a cycle of abuse but i would just feel so bad leaving right now. I feel like i need the perfect time to leave..

please don’t call me stupid or dumb for staying this long, i had rose colored glasses on for so so long. I am severely depressed and my anxiety is at its highest. I have gone to my doctor for prescriptions and am in the process of finding the right therapist.

6636,What are the signs that your relationship is giving you PTSD?,"The main one i find that I have is that I am unable to make a simple decision and have anxiety attacks over his reactions.

For example... today..
I was picking up something from the grocery store for dinner, but they didn't have the ingredient we usually use, so I called to find out if a substitute ingredient would be ok, or should I do something entirely different for dinner.
I was frustrated that, like usual, my calls went unanswered, so I finally made a decision to use the substitute ingredient.
I struggled to hold back tears the whole way home as I was worried what the reaction would be.....did I make the wrong choice?

When I got home, I was rudely told that he didn't care what I chose for dinner and he is annoyed that I keep ringing him to ask, but he also wasn't happy about the substitute ingredient and it would have been better to pick something else to cook.

I have been struggling to hold back tears ever since and I can't stop my hands from shaking 😔

right now I have been in love with someone since I met them a year and a half ago. we've had ups and downs and both come from abuse so we may have trauma bonded as well. we loved each other a lot and got engaged quickly after 6 months. then something unforeseen and unrelated happened and I left. i was in shock from the very bad thing and only tried to ask them to leave with me for a week before just leaving on my own. we stayed in contact and remained in love but no longer engaged due to long distance. like I said bad decision making. now they are at a point where they are asking me to go back and begin where we left off, get a new place, get married, make babes. be a ""hot tattooed couple everyone is jealous of"" as he put it lol.

6649,"Well it finally happened- i was able to get out, but now i don’t know how i feel","As much as I’ve wanted to be out of this terrible relationship for a while now, i was too afraid to voice my own feelings, so i played the long game.

I ended up having to move back in with my parents and him his mom because we couldn’t renew our lease. And because i didn’t want to go on the road with him and live that kind of lifestyle he said he didn’t want me anymore and he broke up with me. 

And as bad as it hurt when he did it, it was peaceful. Didn’t get hit, didn’t get threatened by him, and that’s all i ever wanted. Only worst thing that’s happened is he had my debit card when he left, which i knew but that’s irrelevant, and i trusted him not to use that against me and he did last night.

But now that I’m sitting here i don’t know how i feel. I don’t know why I’m still so hurt by him breaking up with me, and for some reason part of me wants to contact him and make him understand so that we can try again. I know how crazy that is because I’ve been wanting out of this for so long now. I remember literally begging the universe to either put me out of my misery or help me get out in any way and I’ll take it. And the universe answered. 

But my mind seems to constantly remind me of only the good times we’ve had, and i seem to have a hard time constantly reminding myself of all the nights he hit me, all the nights i would cry because of how mean he was that day.

I still have fear, fear that he’s going to retaliate in another way. It hurts, him not even a week ago being loving to me no problem, then telling me he doesn’t want to be with me. Relief, that i won’t get hit anymore even though i have this fear that he will find me and hurt me.

Does anyone have any advice at all on how to cope with all this? I know once i get some money i will have to get therapy for this.

6650,It’s possible.,"Just wanting to give anyone who may need to hear this that it’s possible to leave your abuser. Whether it’s emotional, mental or physical abuse. 

I was in a abusive relationship involving all three aspects and this year I said it was enough. I spent 2-3 years staying with him for the simple fact I was afraid and he truly made me feel like there was no one else that would want to help me or want me. He was manipulative and controlling. He said things to intentionally hurt me and physically hurt me. 

I decided one day enough was enough and I knew if I stayed, something very bad could happen. It took a lot of strength in me and a lot of days crying wondering if I was doing the right thing, but I finally cut him off.

6653,Update + seeking tips for court!,"Hi! A couple weeks ago I posted that I didn’t know how to leave my abuser because of the housing crisis. I had been looking for apartments for a while and not finding anything. He was abusing me, my children, and my dog. 

Things have been wild since then. The following Monday I disclosed the physical abuse to my therapist. Together we called DHHS (my state’s CPS) and reported my abuser together. Less than 24 hours later I was called into DHHS to be interviewed. I told them everything. It was hard but freeing at the same time. Police were contacted based on what i said. 

Someone from my local domestic abuse group was at the meeting and helped make me feel more comfortable. She took me to their headquarters and helped me fill out a Protection from Abuse application. She drove me to the courthouse and sat with me while I waited for the judge to make a decision. My PFA was granted. We dropped it off at the police station together and a detective called me in for questioning right then. I was at the police station for around 8 hours in total that week, and this angel stayed with me the entire time. 

My abuser was removed from the home and a search was conducted based on other things I told the police. Locks have been changed. 

My abuser now has several counts of felony assault charges against him for beating my children and spent a night in jail. His parents bailed him out. 

Next we have court to extend the PFA hearing. Does anyone have experience that they could share on what this looks like? Any tips?

6655,Housing,"It's coming up on a month since I've had to flee my abuser. I was at first paying out of pocket for a hotel room but have since ran out of funds. I did not want to spend the money I had left but I needed to seek shelter and all the shelters nearby were at maximum capacity. By the grace of God, my friend offered her couch for me to sleep on temporarily.  I have since been trying to figure things out with housing assistance but ALWAYS run into a brick wall. Many places/organizations require proof of previous lease which I am unable to provide because I was never on the lease when I was living with my abuser AND I am unable to provide income since I am currently unemployed as my original plan (before the DV altercation occured) was to begin my nursing career which requires me studying for my NCLEX (nursing state exam) first. I feel like if I were to have waited for a shelter to become available and stayed there instead, I would be considered ""higher priority"" for assistance with housing. Granted, I understand that I am blessed to have had my friend opened up her home for me and avoid a shelter but this is only temporary..I feel like I am running in CIRCLES. I feel like my hands are tied and I'm just at a damn loss. 

If anybody has been through this or knows of any resources that can help, I would greatly appreciate it. I tried looking for grants for DV victims to assist with first month rent and security deposit but I don't think there are many or funding has already ran out. (I am located in NJ for reference.)

6656,I don’t understand him,"Last weekend I left for safety reasons to stay with my parents for a while. I said I was okay with keeping contact over the phone but I noticed that he kept trying to find reasons for me to come back home and I got roped into spending the whole of today with him anyways on the premise that it was for his grandfather and mother. 

Because of that, I decided to tell him this evening that I’d like to go no contact till Sunday morning and that then I’ll come over and we can talk. He seemed very sad and I felt awful. When I left he asked if he could walk me to the parking which is 300m from our apartment. I said no, that I wanted to say goodbye at the door and I’d see him Sunday. 

He said that wasn’t a problem but as I left our apartment he filmed me all the way to my car with his drone and kept filming right in front of my car’s front window while I got in and started the car. Luckily my parents live more than 2km from us so he couldn’t follow me all the way there but I’m just so confused. Especially because I’ve told him multiple times that I don’t want him to fly the drone near me.

I don’t understand how he can be so upset about me leaving and simultaneously continue to cross my boundaries when I’ve made it so clear what I need.

6671,I can't fight anymore,"Backstory: I got an ADVO (it's a really simple one, only no abuse and no destruction of property, he can still have contact and be on the premises) last September after he choked me, but eventually convinced the police to drop the charges, because I thought he was really trying and improving.  
4 days after the charges were dropped, he becomes abusive again and undoes all of his months of work. I didn't tell the police what happened or that he breached the order, but I did throw him out of the house so he's been couch surfing for a week.  

All week he's been all about how to make it better and be better, but I was reluctant to let him back and said he should try looking for a more permanent place. Then last night he flips and blames me, says how everyone keeps telling him he has to prioritise my feelings and his feelings just don't matter,  even if I say or do hurtful things he's not allowed to be angry and he doesn't think it's fair so he completely cut contact. My emotions freaked out and I suddenly couldn't bare the thought of losing him, so I try contacting him and go looking for him and end up not sleeping or working or eating. I finally got in contact around midday today and convinced him to come back home tonight, so he'll be here soon again.  

I think I've just accepted I'm not strong enough to be on my own, the loneliness really kills me, I don't even care anymore if he hurts me I feel so numb. I have to just never care about my needs or feelings again, and become the type of fawning people pleaser I absolutely loath in other people. I can't fight for myself anymore, I'm so tired.  

Update: apparently he didn't come to stay. He could hear something was wrong, he didn't think I sounded like myself anymore, so he didn't bring his things, just came to talk and help me get back on my feet (I've been depressed and not eating, cleaning, etc.) then left again. It makes me even more unsure of what to do, because realistically he can't keep couch surfing forever until I decide.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

&#x200B;

i broke free from my abuser recently,yet i still feel the need to defend him when my friends talk bad about him (""loser"",""incel"",""evil"",""doesn't deserve a gf). its like another part of me jumps in before i could do anything. my parents found out and they were reasonable upset. i don't blame them for that at all yet i still felt hurt when they suggested he could've been some 30 year old creep or just someone who uses women. they're right,100%..but why do i feel this way? what he did to me was horrible,i'll never forget..yet i still hope nothing for the best for him and his family. is this shockholm sydrome or am i just sick in the head?

   

he was very much ablest,or very ignorant towards anyone with mental health issues. he'd make fun of me for my issues only to pull a ""even r3t@rd$ can marry!the hell is ur excuse??your lucky i even bothered talking to you"" over something as simple as not liking something trivial. then goes back to acting like neurodivergents are the scum of the earth. i've been groomed and molested by a woman i should've trusted and he knew that. he'd use that to his advantage. he knew sexual things bothered me until i broke down,so he'd use objectifying names,lewding things i enjoy,ect,until i break down and beg for his forgiveness. rape threats were frequent as well, he'd forgive me if i'm lucky or use ""the speech"" he'd say hurtful things like:

**you are a black girl,a fetish,if you want me to treat you better dont piss me off**

   i tried not to let it bother me. i told myself he didnt mean it..then why do i feel the need to run away or side eye a man that doesn't demonize/objectify my body like he did? it felt normal even though its not. i often find myself backing away from someone that smiles at me,a sweet genuine smile. sweet gentle men/women come across as creeps to me and i hate it. is that normal too?is it possible for a partner to respect their lover's body? as a questioning demisexual i'd like to know. same goes for partners with mental issues such as ptsd&regression,and autism (not a issue but i still want to know)

6675,am I being punished,"My boyfriend(M27) and I (F19) got into an argument recently because he was upset with me for turning my phone off completely for 3 hours. He gave me the silent treatment the entire day after our argument until last night we finally called and discussed it. He claims that if I was able to do exactly that and forget him for 3 hours that I don’t love him at all and that I don’t care for him. He says he’s now going to stop expecting things from me and from everyone since they all just disappoint him. He says my actions never match my words because since I never let him know what I’m doing all the time or am able to just leave the way I did through the phone that I simply disappointed him. I ended up apologizing to him and saying that it was entirely my fault and that I can do better, and if there’s any boundaries he doesn’t like me crossing to express those instead of keeping them in and not saying anything until last minute. I never knew he would have a huge problem with me turning my phone off that way, and for him to give me the silent treatment for an entire day felt like punishment. Now after the discussion he just agreed that we have to do better but that he needs time to “heal” and that he doesn’t feel good to be like himself. Usually wouldn’t a problem as simple as this be solved without it carrying on for the next couple of days? He did tell me he loves me in the end and that he doesn’t want me to cry or feel bad at all. But now it’s the next day and he’s not the same towards me and I’m still feeling extremely guilty. I have no reason to feel this way if I already did my part and took the blame yet I still do because he’s giving me the cold shoulder. Is this another tantrum…..?

6680,Nex crossed a line that made the supervisor realize she was not doing a good job for the kids.,"I feel like this is a convoluted mess, but I'll try to keep it as simple as I can.  There are a lot of players in this.  After my previous post, I called and left the GAL a message first thing Monday morning. GAL didn't call me back until Thursday.  GAL did appear to be appropriately appalled by what the visit supervisor said to me and said she'd call the court and see what they recommended and would let me know.  I still haven't heard back.


Nex had another visit scheduled for Sunday.  I took my DD, I got there about 5 minutes before the visit was scheduled and the supervisor wasn't there yet.  She arrived with a minute to spare, didn't say a word to me and took the kids inside.  After the visit, the supervisor told the other mom to please let her know if there were any problems, she didn't look at me or speak with me.  I thought that was weird, maybe since the other mom was causing a larger fuss or something?


My DD doesn't tell me anything about the visit, just that it was fun.  Then the other mom starts texting me questions to ask.  The supervisor sat with nex's mom talking to her while nex made passive aggressive comments to his oldest(DD didn't hear it, or says she didn't, but agreed that the supervisor was just sitting with nexmil talking and not really paying attention).  Then I find out that nex decided that the rules about who was there was only for physical location and nex called his father on Skype so that his dad could see the kids.  The supervisor claims she was upset about that and that was why she was talking with nexmil instead of paying attention to what nex was saying and doing with the kids. 



Anyone know why the supervisor just complained to nexmil and didn't shut the call down? Shut the visit down? Yeah, me neither.  The other mom told the supervisor that the oldest doesn't trust her or her ability to keep her safe and stop nex's nonsense and asked her if she would be able to stand up to nex at the next visit.  The supervisor responded that she would try to get us a new supervisor.  I guess at least she recognized that she wasn't in control and these weren't going as well as she assumed they were. 


We have a new supervisor who is male and had been doing this for over 20 yrs.  I hope he is able to see right through nex and not put up with any of his ish.

6689,Intense fatigue and sickness beginning/worsening months after abuse,"I (23F) was in an incredibly abusive relationship (physically/emotionally) from early 2022 to early 2023 (cohabiting). Once I had escaped the relationship, I spent a couple of months unable to function and having to have someone physically with me 24/7 and was having a lot of PTSD flashbacks etc, and having lots of emotional breakdowns daily. The moment this began to ease off, I got busy, all the time. I was either working, at the gym, socialising, doing chores or engaging in new hobbies - anything so I didn't have to be alone with my thoughts, and eventually the flashbacks almost stopped and the sudden breakdowns stopped completely. I felt a lot more stable but stayed incredibly busy through until November.
I had noticed that since the abuse started (which was the same month I had covid), I was getting sick often - it would always be a mild cold, maybe a headache, but it wasnt something that ever used to happen. This continued through to November too, and it always used to happen after I had exercised or been particularly busy, so it was happening regularly, but I seemed to recover easily each time, with the help of extra food and occasionally painkillers.
In early November, I caught some kind of flu, and I never really recovered. The tiredness and sickness skyrocketed and ever since, I have been housebound, some weeks bedbound, unable to really do anything. A good day for me now appears to be a shower, cooking a simple meal from scratch, and a slow 5-10 min walk. Anything beyond that, and I'm bedbound for a few days, with flu symptoms and awful headaches. I've also noticed that since I've had to stop being busy, my flashbacks and emotional breakdowns are back in full force, but I do find after any bout of crying, my symptoms are slightly better for an hour or 2, and I feel lighter and relieved. I have been diagnosed with PTSD (months ago). I am soon to start EMDR therapy to help with this, but it's possible this could also be long covid symptoms (although I don't know how that would match up with the sudden exponential increase in symptoms since November)

Really what I wanted to know is, has anyone else had a situation like this, does the fatigue and illness disappear/decrease after properly processing the trauma? Is it normal for exhaustion and sickness to hit like this after so long? I imagine I've been suppressing a lot of the trauma, by being so busy?
I'm just really scared at the moment, as there's been mention of chronic fatigue, and I'm scared I won't get my life back. Is there hope for this to improve?

6694,Feeling defeated,"It’s been five days since I told my partner we were done. I’ve gotten such good support here and I’m so grateful. I know it was the only way forward and I’m sure it’ll get better.

Because we have a 3 month old daughter we need to keep in contact. I’ve spoken with a lawyer and I have no way of keeping her from him, I need to make sure they have a relationship, othervise I might lose custody in the future. I’m from a european country with very strong parental rights.

We are still figuring out what to do with everything. The problem is that he is being so incredibly mean… a simple question of when he wants to see her next is met with a ton of hate… he is rewriting history completely and I’m the villain in the story. This is expected. But the amount of hurtful things he is writing to me is getting to me. It is endless stream of attacks, using intimate details from my life and the most absurd and unfair accusations.

He also wants me to pay for things he need (he has a very low income but Imm paying for the apartment where he’s staying for the next 6 months). I stupidly gave him money for a new phone. I cannot utter the word “no” to him. It’s extremely stressful. He is also saying I need to somehow provide him with housing because he is the father of my child. Other vise our daughter will hate me. The irony I spend lessmoney than he does and I never buy anything for myself.  I bought everything for our daughter second hand. I do have my own business that I’ve worked my ass of for in order to be able to raise a child and supoort us both. It feels so unfair but I don’t want to argue with him cause there’ no point.

I know I’ll need to set up a schedule and a line of communication like email but it’s all so new and I feel completey depleated with the attacks. He varies between bring nice and mean. The abuse is still ongoing.

6697,My first year away from my abuser,".

Sometimes I feel alone like I have changed so much and I wish people knew what I survived before judging me on who i am and how I act. Everything has changed me sometimes people think I am weird  or the  way I lie is about them,  but if you were trained to lie to not end up beaten, it would be so different. I wish I could have someone live a day in my shoes to know what it was like when you go into battle with someone you wished loved you over something as simple as cooking the food wrong. If I could  erase those 10 years of my life wasted I would. How can I focus on school when it is always there muddling my thoughts. The thing that got me the most though was every time I thought this is the night I don't end up falling because  once you fall it's  over he  has all the  control and there is nothing you can do about it. I would fall so easy too I constantly worked  out I was stronger than most men. Did it change the way I fell? no. Did it change my surprise when he  hit me no. Not knowing where the blood was coming from how bad the damage was. Now he is in jail for raping  a woman while with me and wants visitation with my son I am hoping  to get sole custody, but who knows I never reported the abuse. Even when I went to the hospital numerous times I always lied.",yes,no,yes,yes,plausibly,,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
6701,Can someone give me some honest advice?,"So I'm going to be honest. I'm not a clean person. Not in the sense of personal hygiene but rather keeping the house I share with my husband clean. My spaces tend to be messy and cluttered. And this in turn infuriates my husband. However it's not only my messes but simple chores like washing dishes and folding laundry that go unchecked. And like my cluttered spaces it ticks him off. My husband works from 8 until 6:30 every day except weekends. I on the other hand am a full time college student and can work up to 30 hours a week and I typically don't get weekends off. 

Now to get into what I feel is off. So as I mentioned I'm not a very consistent clean person. And our house at this point has gotten out of hand. So my husband last weekend finally broke and got extremely mad. Saying that he feels like if there's no change it'll eventually lead to divorce. Now this isn't the first time he's used divorce as a threat. He's done it in our sex life when he wasn't getting enough sex and when I would tell him I didn't want to have sex with him. In this situation however he said it seems the only way he ever got me to change when it came to being clean was by breaking my things. Which he has done in the past. However I told him that doing that is abusive and by doing that it'll eventually make me want to leave. I know I shouldn't have said it but the threat of divorce has been used so much in our relationship that it's become sort of numb to me when even the thought used to make me extremely emotional. This time though he tried to find another way to punish me. By using physical activity. Saying if I don't do everything he'll make me run 4 laps outside in our neighborhood (for context it's about a mile). And would not let me go back inside until I do. That even if I puke or say I feel like I'm gonna pass out he still won't let me go back inside. Now at the time I agreed but now I'm feeling like I shouldn't have. Like I just gave him exactly what he wanted. Because he literally said that he's going to enjoy watching me suffer. (I'm not in shape so if I go outside and run a mile especially in 100° weather I'll feel like I'm dying) 

Can anyone give me some advice? Even about how to be more consistently clean with an extremely busy schedule.

6707,He won't let me break up with him and is threatening me. I don't know how to handle this.,"I broke up with him 2 years ago because he was emotionally abusing and would blow up my phone whenever we had an argument.

I don't know why I was stupid enough to go back. I know that the simple answer is to leave. But my mom (and my whole family)  don't know I got back with him. My mom has always disapproved of this relationship.

She trusts me and is very old-school. Several times, I've lied to her, telling her I'm going over at my friend's place, when in reality, I was sleeping at my bf's place.

Whenever I tell him I want to leave, he says that he'll come to my house and reveal everything to my mom. He has threatened to send people over at my place. And then says he won't do it just to manipulate me. 

I don't know how to deal with this. We just had a fight today. He screamed in my face and looked like he wanted to hit me. 

I'm scared of him showing up at my house and making a scene in front of the neighbours and my family. 

I told him today I don't deserve this, but he says that while we were not together, he never acted like this and I'm the one who's making him behave this way. 

The other day, he forced me to get in his car to go to his house. I feel like I won't be able to go without the situation becoming dramatic.

6713,My (24f) boyfriend (27m) is the only one ‘allowed’ to be poly in our relationship.,"I’ve been with my current boyfriend for 4 years now. We’ve known each other since middle school, and up until a few weeks ago, or relationship with each other has always been great. Now, I bring up how long I’ve know him because I want to say this - he has never claimed to be poly before. For the many years I’ve known him and for the 4 years I’ve been with him, he has always claimed that he was mono. That’s why I’m having such a hard time truly understanding and comprehending this.

About two weeks back, he came to me telling me that he was poly and that he wanted to try adding someone else to our relationship. While this did catch me off guard, I did consider it and figured that it wouldn’t hurt to try. I was promised that if I didn’t end up liking it, I could call it off at any time and that it would go back to just being us.

Fast forward to a day ago. The poly thing has been kinda working for us! I’ve been getting along really well with our new partner, when my boyfriend says he wants to talk. He tells me that he doesn’t like how it seems like I’m trying to get with this other partner, despite us being in a poly relationship. I’m confused and ask him what he means. He tells me that the other person in the relationship was only meant to date him. I was not allowed to be with her because, in his own words, he “doesn’t want to have to share me with anyone else”. This, of course, rubbed me the wrong way. I immediately became extremely uncomfortable and for the rest of yesterday kinda distanced myself from him.

I am autistic. I have other mental issues. While some people might think the solution to this is simple, I am quite frankly feeling hurt and at a loss. This is the first time I have ever been in a poly relationship.

Is this normal? Am I the one overreacting? Is it wrong for me to feel hurt?

6719,Hypersensitivity and Anger,"Have y’all experienced partners that are hypersensitive and angry? 

Yesterday my partner was cooking and my 10 year old son (not his child) walked up to us in the kitchen and said “You’re short”. They chatted for a minute. And then my son left the kitchen. 

Immediately my partner got upset and told me that I needed to discipline him for being disrespectful to adults. I asked my partner to explain how he was being disrespectful by making an observation and statement. He said “if I start making observations and ask your son why he is black or “where’s your dad?” then I guess that wouldn’t be rude since it’s an observation” 

I immediately felt my chest tighten and my heart begin to beat fast. He got extremely angry at me for not controlling my son, but my son’s intentions were pure. My son was just making a simple observation because my partner isn’t around my son much, so my son noticed his height. 

Also, I took my son to the side and told him that my partner got his feelings hurt by being called short and to apologize. 

My son walked in the kitchen and said “I’m sorry for calling you short”. My partner immediately smirked at me and acted completely nice to my son and brushed it off like it didn’t bother him at all. 

Why would my partner make a big deal out of this situation to only act like I’m in the wrong by making him apologize? 

Absolutely insane to me!

6725,"I don't know if this falls under gaslighting or not, but I hate it so much","My husband does this thing where he will get mad at me for situations he caused but acts like he didn't. Like, a good example is when he gets mad at me for having a headache and will condescendingly (and loudly) say things like, ""you just don't know how to listen to your body! You don't have healthy habits! You won't let me help me you! You won't take time off from work when you're pain! Why are you so stubborn?"" (He curses at me a lot more when he says this stuff, but you get the idea.) 

But he is the one only let me get four hours of sleep. He the one who doesn't let me nap. He is the one who never lets me ""listen to my body"" about my own sleep schedule. I wake up when he decides. I've long lost this battle. 

Listening to him vent from the couch instead of listening to him vent while I work from my laptop isn't a headache cure. If I can't nap, I'm gonna work. This never seems to matter/sink in/occur to him. (Unless he's doing it on purpose?)

Or when I get yelled because he's mad he's had to, ""beg me at least six times to care about his medical needs. (He told me to call pharmacy for him. Twice. While I was working.) and it ""makes him feel like he's parenting a child who needs constant reminders to do simple tasks,""  and ""it feels like he is taking on 98 percent of the burden around here.""

But he could solve this by simply making his phone calls. If he wants me to do these things for him, he should probably be patient and deal with the fact that I am also the only one of us who has a job. I don't know if that doesn't matter to him or if it's all intentional manipulation. 

Whatever any of it is, I hate it so much. I can't defend myself without starting an actual fight, something that's not a good/safe idea. (Plus, this almost always happens while I'm working). And it just leaves me feeling so awful.

6737,Question for anyone who was SA in their marriages,"My now ex husband of 7 years  SA-ed me a number of times in our marriage. During the beginning of our divorce he threatened to do so a few times but luckily didn't.
He wasn't the first man to do this to me and because of my past relationships and other men from my childhood, I have always had an issue with others touching me. My Ex husband was a very rare exception to that, until he wasn't. I have an issue with others walking behind me or blocking my exit out of rooms, standing to near or even as simple as my  mother giving me a hug is a hardship in many ways. Makes my skin crawl an makes me feel like I'm on fire or covered in millions of insects.

All in all I've always had a hard time, but when I met my ex I never had any of those issues. In fact some of them faded until he SA-ed me. I'm now divorced for a month and I know things are bound to take time, yet I'm worried about how my next partner will feel to me.
If I will feel safe to have anyone touch me, if my body won't try and jerk away from it.

6742,Boyfriend is always angry,"I don’t know how to move forward.  My boyfriend is a good person until he isn’t. In the past few months, there’s always something that makes him angry. He becomes moody and irritated over the most simple things.

Examples: traffic, bad drivers on the road, work, dogs barking, our dog needing to go out to pee, something I forgot to do.

I’ve BEGGED him to seek professional help and see a therapist but he’s the type of person who will never admit something is wrong. He says if he does have mental health issues, it’s my fault and I caused it. 

Sometimes I think he’s a textbook narcissist (I know this word is over-used) and other times I think he’s stressed out or has underlying mental health issues.

I’m walking on eggshells in my own home and doing everything I can to avoid an argument, but he always finds something. Nothing I do is EVER good enough. He does nothing on his end to change anything about his life. The arguments have caused him to withdraw from any intimacy or quality time. He looks at me with disgust but won’t let me put our house on the market so we can go our separate ways. 

I’m financially stuck with him until we sell our house and I can afford an apartment for myself. I did actually put the house on the market a month ago out of desperation but he tore the “for sale” sign down and contacted the realtor to delete the listing.

I have my own mental health issues and haven’t always been a good partner, so that’s probably why I give him so many chances. I never thought people could change until I stopped blaming everyone around me  for my shortcomings and worked on myself. Therapy helped me learn how to not take out my anger at others or name-call.

Her husband pitch a big fit when she said something.  Most people were responding that this was abusive behavior that their SO would divorce them for this.  I posted something simple like wow that seems excessive to me.  I got so many downvotes I was amazed.  And something finally hit me I have been treated that way by so many men that I didn't realize it was abusive.  Am I making sense?  This is all just really sinking in. I also wonder if my response would have been considered to be abusive because I tend to be sarcastic and have said so are you ordering pizza?  My father was very abusive and I have been through a lot of trauma work when I was in my thirties.  But this last relationship became extremely abusive and I allowed it.

Someone who loves me unconditionally. Some to flirt with me. Hold me. Kiss me. Someone to be excited about the future with. Someone who shares themselves with me. Someone who cares about me. Someone who cares about my children. Someone to go on adventures with. Someone to travel the world with. Someone who actively plans a life with me.”

To which he responded hahaha you’ll never get that from me. You’re not the person you think you are. You don’t have what it takes to do that.

I feel so confused. I grew up in a big loving family. I was happy before I met him. Tried to give my children the best life. I have gotten short tempered at times and paranoid due to his cheating, getting his own place and refusing to move back in. I just want a happy, simple life. But I feel like is it me?! 

I have completely lost myself to his false promises, lies and the rest. He completely pulled away and is distant and doesn’t want this anymore as I beg him to try.

my boyfriend (33m) and the father of my babies seems to despise me..

Easy to be with but we have decided to stay together multiple times..

I’m not saying anything cause I’m not arguing”… 
 “ you want a fight? Then continue “
I have been trying my hardest not to do anything to upset him.. if he says leave him alone I do, I have been trying to not ask for his help caring for our children and not to bother him… 
But when I finally stand up for myself and say what I feel, it ends up really bad for us… usually just me.
Crying in front/around my babies… which makes me feel like a horrible mother.. being so upset. 
feeling so alone.. like I have no one..
Can’t talk to the people closest to me about it because I have been here so many times before now it just seems ridiculous to talk about anymore.. they would tell me leave like they have in the past.. it’s so hard by the time I have the strength to do it, he pulls me back in… like he doesn’t want me to leave but doesn’t seem to want me around.. 
I ask myself all the time..
Is it just me .?? Is it my fault?
How can he be so capable of being so cruel to me?? 
Should I just make myself let go?
I know I stay because I want what’s best for our kids and I love him and love that he’s the father to our babies and I love our family but maybe what’s best for me and my babies is us not being together( I have thought about that so much)

We will start to discuss something (news, meme on fb, a commercial) and he will give his perspective but if mine is different then he has to keep telling me his point over and over. Even if I say I understand his point but sometimes we can both be right. Not everything is right or wrong. But when it gets to that point he is already getting mad and talking loud, not quite yelling but close. I can just be sitting there and he keeps going with the same point. 

I can't tell him that I wanna do cuz he gives reasons of y I shouldn't and y he doesn't want to do it. So I've gotten to a point I don't tell him anything till I'm leaving for the event and that makes him mad cuz I'm rejecting him.

I can't talk to him about my f3amily cuz he ends up pointing out what they have done wrong and y they are not great people. I can't complain about my family to him cuz he will jump on that and tell me why he doesn't like them. He will talk about how they look (fat or stupid) and try to convince me that I don't need to help my family or do anything for them. 

Few times I've tried to tell him something that's happened and if I hesitate or accidentally jump around in the story then he thinks I'm lying about it. He has told me to wait till something went off tv before telling him but then I don't get another chance.

BUT...when I do wear the sexy things, he tells me I love it when you dress like  that, I wish you'd dress like the more often,  you have the figure for it, or he even raises his eyebrows, gives me a big smile. Essentially, gives me lots of attention and positive verbal comebacks. In the past 5 years, he always buys me sexy lingerie for birthdays, Christmas, or early in the relationship lingerie and bathing suits. He will even comment on how he wants me to wear my hair in a certain way, yet when I wear my hair normally, doesn't say anything, but just a casual yeah its really nice.

Then on the couch, he will feel me up, then go to bed by himself.  (we sleep separate because of insomnia and apnea) So he always gets me worked up on Sat nights, but not do anything about it until the next day...when and IF he wants to.  Then goes to tell me that if I take care of my urge, then I don't need him for sex. So then I feel like I can't because he will know if I do because I can't climax for him.

I've never met another man who likes a woman to climax so much. I find it odd. But then brags because he tires me out and I can't keep up with him. Like I should keep going.

So I get the feeling, that I need to look a certain way, dress a certain way and even not take care of my own urges and save it for him. Sooooo I think he has manipulated me into thinking like this.

6776,I (20f) got ghosted by the guy I was seeing (23m) and I don’t know how to move on,"
Me (20f) and the guy I was seeing (23m) for the past year were never officially together but we spent pretty much every second of our free time together, told each other we loved each other, slept together, met each others parents and friends, etc (Crazy, i know lol). 

He basically completely ghosted me about two weeks ago and I am heartbroken. He basically texted me and told me he was having a hard time mentally and wanted to be alone and with his friends. He also said, “but it’s not like we’ll never talk again”.

As much as this took me by surprise, as we were completely fine and happy just two days prior, I tried to keep my composure and just replied with a simple “Okay. I understand.” And i haven’t texted him since. 

It has now been a little over two weeks and I thought I was getting better until I decided to stalk his socials and now I feel like i’m back at where I started. Maybe I even feel worse than before. I don’t know.

I noticed he started following this girl on Instagram and he’s been commenting on all of her posts and I feel like he has already found a replacement for me. I can’t wrap my head around it, I am so so hurt and so sad. I’m really trying to keep it together, to keep moving forward and I keep telling myself that none of this is my fault. But it’s like every time I close my eyes I just see him with this new girl and I can’t understand how it happened so quickly. 
I have so much love for him and even though we weren’t actually together, we talked about our future together all the time and I really felt like I had found the one for me. 

I have never had a boyfriend before but he was my first kiss, first person i’ve been intimate with, my first everything. 

Does anyone have any tips to stop stalking his socials? Other than blocking him of course, as I just don’t feel ready to do that yet. 

And does anyone have any tips on moving on in a healthy way? My friends suggested going on a dating app and finding someone else to talk to but that just doesn’t feel right to me.

6777,What to do about my (29F) husband (26M) transferring his fear of his parents onto me?,"Hello, friends.

My husband (26M) grew up in a difficult family, to say the least. His parents were survivors of abuse themselves who never exactly grew up and went on to be pretty awful to Husband. We started dating online and long-distance for a number of years and whenever things got rough, we would write down all the things we imagined for our lives together: simple things like cooking and hiking and just enjoying each others' company. Easy dreams. It kept him going whenever either of us had tough days.

Five years later, we're now married and live together. It was a long process and I had to move internationally to make it happen, but I thought it would be worth it just to be with him and to bring those dreams to life.

It's been eight months since I made that move and things have not been going great, to put it lightly. When he lived with his parents, he feared and hid away from them and lived anxiously around them - now that's what he's doing to me. He used to hide away from his parents in his bedroom and talk to friends online... now he's hiding from me and talking to *other* people online. Any little thing can and will make him upset - even something as small as *looking* at him in a way that isn't perfectly cheerful and happy and he is constantly worried that I'm angry with him at all times of day. Any form of critique, no matter how gentle, will send him spiralling - in fact if I try too hard to be gentle, he'll think I'm being patronising and get upset over *that*.

We talk about it constantly, and I try my best to put a great deal of effort into using non-violent communication, trying to broach things gently, trying to meet him at his level, trying to keep him calm. It almost never works completely.

It's starting to get pretty exhausting and sometimes I feel like not only did he break a promise to me in some way by not relaxing around me and having me feel anxious all the time, but I also feel like I've broken a promise to *him* by not being patient enough at all times, by not being a safe person to relax around, by not holding up my own end of the bargain.

6784,I (F21) can’t just take compliments (M22),"Hello all!

I am in a healthy, loving relationship. We’ve been together for around 4 years now and have been doing long distance for the majority of the time. This man is my best friend and soulmate. Earlier in our relationship, something I noticed was that he wasn’t a very big compliment giver. See, I’m a big words-of-affirmation girl. Whenever I see him, I tell him how attractive he is. And I’m not just saying “you look cute.” I am creative and passionate with my compliments and I genuinely mean them. So when he wasn’t really complimenting me, I got a bit insecure and tbh, I’m already kind of an insecure person. We had a talk about it and I brought up how I really value compliments and words of affirmation, and those are the ways in which I like to give and receive love. He was very understanding (he is amazing) and since then he has complimented me more. 

That seems like it would be an enough, right? See, now I have another issue. Even though he is complimenting me and I know that he probably means them, I just can’t help but feel insecure and feel like he’s only saying them because he knows I want to hear it, not because he truly wants to compliment me. My insecurities aren’t helped by the fact that this dude…isn’t the best with his words. He gives me very simple compliments like “you look cute.” I KNOW I sound so ungrateful and insecure, but when it’s such simple compliments it just adds to my feeling that he doesn’t genuinely mean them.

I know this is a me problem for sure. I’ve felt this way before with my mom. She’s said some hurtful stuff about my appearance in the past and after I told her how painful that was for me, she started complimenting me more and I never ever believe her. I just really don’t know how to deal with my insecurities and I don’t want this to negatively impact our relationship.",irrelevant,no,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
6797,"I (f21) got married to my husband (m29) because I was pregnant, and now I regret it so much. ","I got married seven months ago. I was pregnant then, I found out on my 21st birthday. We thought it was the right thing to do, considering we didn’t even try for the pregnancy. 

  I lost the baby really early on but we’ve stayed married. I really, *really*, regret it now. I pray my husband doesn’t find this post.

  My husband used to be the most amazing man in the world. He was so kind and polite and caring and loving. He still can be, sometimes, but mostly, he’s the opposite. Everything I do he snaps at, I literally can’t do anything right. The way I dress, act, talk, respond, wear my hair or makeup, anything gets a comment and sometimes a ridicule. He’s been so vicious lately and I can’t stand it. He still takes me on dates and acts like that’ll make it all better. Like all of the sex we have isn’t for his benefit only. Like my opinions don’t even matter. Like everything will be better and okay again and my bruises will heal if he treats me nice for a night. 

  I’ve told him I don’t want to be married anymore- and that was a huge mistake. It resulted in the biggest argument we’ve ever had. He told me he doesn’t want to divorce me. He loves me. And I do love him still too, but this obviously isn’t good enough for a relationship, at least not a healthy one. He’s told me before that if I try to divorce him, he just won’t sign the papers. Simple as that. 

  I don’t know what to do. I take my ring off at work because I just don’t want people to ask. Because of this, my coworker thought I was single. He started to flirt with me. This is absolutely horrific, I know, but I would be unfaithful to my husband if I wasn’t terrified what he’d do if he found out. 

  What do I fucking do? Obviously divorce is off the table. I still love my husband so much but he’s so different. I’ve heard people say the first year of marriage is the hardest, so maybe this will get better? Has anyone else ever dealt with this?

6799,My boyfriend (24M) treats and lectures me (27F) like a child every day. Is this abusive behavior?,"Throw away because he uses reddit too. 

My boyfriend is extremely high strung and is a control freak. He’s always getting on me over the smallest things. I just got new glasses and sometimes I will put them down and not wear them for a short time. He will lecture me and get on me about not wearing my glasses and tells me how I need to be more responsible for keeping them close to me. He will lecture me for 5 minutes everytime he sees them on the kitchen table or counter. 

He asks me to play video games with him in our free time and I do. Whenever we play and I make a mistake or start getting anxious because he gets mad and upset when I make a simple mistake or take too long doing something he becomes agitated and starts lecturing me about the game. It makes me not want to play with him then he gets mad when I don’t play games with him anymore. He sucks the fun out of it and tries to explain the game to me and tell me everything I need to do like I can’t figure it out myself. 

When I’m driving us somewhere if he doesn’t like the way i’m driving he lectures me and tries to “teach me” a better way to drive. If I do the same to him he gets upset and tells me “don’t tell me how to drive” even though he gets bad road rage and it’s dangerous sometimes. 

Was doing my nails today and he got onto me about how I wasn’t doing them correctly. I dismissed him and tuned him out because i’m so exhausted by his constant nagging, lectures and double standards. I talk to him about it and he says “this is how my parents treated me so I treat you this way subconsciously” says he will work on it but always goes back to square one. 

This partnership doesn’t feel equal. If I try to even voice my advice or opinions he gets mad and says “it’s unsolicited advice and I sound like his mother and to stop” but he does it to me and I ask him to stop and he gets mad I won’t listen to him. It’s contradictory and I feel I never get a break. I’m so exhausted.

6801,what the hell is wrong with my (23f) and my boyfriends (23m) communication?,"i (23f) and my boyfriend (23m) keep having really extreme arguments over basic and simple things because he will say something and then Immediately afterwards insist that he never said it. 

as an example, tonight i was watching him draw a picture of his character who has always had black hair. in the drawing he gave her blonde eyebrows, so i asked if that implied that the character did not have naturally black hair. he replied that that was most likely the case, but he wasnt sure yet, but that the oc did enjoy dyeing her hair, so the answer is likely yes. i laughed about it a little considering her black hair was very iconic to her and let it go. very soon after that (im talking 30 seconds or so) he flips out and starts saying things like ""i didnt mean to draw her that way"" and ""i did that mistakenly"". i mentioned that he just told me that this artistic choice was thought out and quoted what he had said and mentioned how recently he said it. he starts crying and stomping his feet and telling me that he doesnt remember at all telling me these things and how confused he is that i would say that he said them. 

he does this a lot. the example i gave is of a very immature arguement we had that doesnt have many external consequences, but he does this kind of thing about serious things he says too. or he will hear me say the same sentence over and over but then tell me he heard something different. (ex. the other day he bought me a bottle of wine for valentines day and we shared it. he picked up my glass and i repeated ""that is my glass"" 3 times and after he drank from it, he told me he thought i said ""bottle"")

of course i feel like he is lying or trying to manipulate me but the way he talks makes me really believe he truly does not know what is going on. What the hell? does anyone have an explanation for this?

6805,I (22f) don't feel loved by my boyfriend (23m) and I'm not sure how to move forward,"

We were highschool sweethearts that now have two kids, a 4 year old and an infant. I have hardly ever thought my boyfriend truly loved me and I've talked about it with him many times. To be completely fair, I don't feel like anyone loves me except for my grandmother. In the 6 years we've been together none of our friends have showed up for my birthday. They always come for his though and our birthdays are only 1 week apart. He hardly ever gets me gifts on the actual day (birthdays, anniversaries, holidays) and tends to order me a gift online the day of so I'll get it like a week or two later. For Christmas this year the only thing he got me was some pairs of socks and an ornament he got from the grocery store when he went shopping for our dinner that night. He gave it to me straight out of the bag, didn't even wrap the stuff. There have been many nights that I lay in bed crying while he falls asleep beside me, not caring how upset he's made me. He refuses to apologize if he doesn't feel like it's a big enough deal to. I don't feel like he respects me at all, and there's a good chance this is all my own brain making me feel like no one in my life loves me. I just don't know what else I can say to my boyfriend to make him start putting in more effort because it really seems pointless. Nothing has changed no matter how much I talk to him about it. I know the simple answer everyone likes to say is to break up, but it's not that easy. I'm a stay at home mom with no real support system. This family of him and the kids is my entire life, but I'm just not happy anymore. I'm irritable and sad. I miss the beginning of our relationship. And I get that relationships change when people get comfortable, but I don't think it's normal that when your partners comfortable they get super mean.

6828,I (24F) have been increasingly concerned about my appearance since being cheated on by my boyfriend (29M),"Hi,  I'm new here. I'm not quite ready to talk about what happened with my boyfriend and his cheating, but I have been coping in an unusual way (for me) and wondered if anyone could relate. I'll just keep it simple:

After finding out about the cheating, I'm constantly improving and maintaining my hygiene and appearance. The list of things I have to do is quite extensive. I've spent so many hours today doing my nails and hair and makeup. I'm working out again, which is good, but I'm so tired.

This might sound silly to complain about and I guess it's generally a good way to cope, as it's benefiting me. But it's getting pretty exhausting and not leaving much room for much else in my life. It really isn't normal for me, I've never been much of a 'girly girl'. I'm usually the kind of girl that doesn't worry too much about my hair being messy. I like how laidback and easygoing I felt before I found out. Now, I'm worried I'm becoming vain. So preoccupied with beauty, like a fixation. I know it's just a way to cope, but hopefully I won't feel this way forever. It's quite literally getting in the way of living my life. 

&#x200B;

Anyway would love to know if anyone else has experienced this or has an opinion on it. Also -- no this definitely isn't a competition with the girls he was talking to, it's more so for me, strangely. Hopefully this isn't a stupid post. I also don't know if the need support flair makes sense but it's what I'm going with.

It doesn’t even have to be something pertinent to THEM. Crazy triggers that seem to have zero connection, but sometimes as simple as watching a movie that has her name for a character.

I’ve always valued my friendships more than my relationships(all of my relationships have always ended up with him cheating - what is wrong with me; maybe that’s why this all happened…but because one of my “friends” did this to me, I no longer find myself capable of making friendships at all. 

I WANT to make it work with him…most of the time it does feel like we can and are moving forward positively.

6833,Me F34 him M38 - do I stay or do I go?,"Me F34 him M38 - do I stay or do I go?

Not sure whether to call it quits or stick it out..

I don't even know why I'm asking here but I'm going to try and rationalise my thoughts. Have been with my partner now for 10 years in Oct. Last year in September October he ended up cheating on me with another woman. A customer of all people! He's a decorator and she went out of her way to ""woo"" him as she's in an unhappy marriage. I can confirm she's a psycho after much investigation. 

He owns the house we live in and he asked me to leave, so I did. We spent approx 2 weeks apart then mutually decided to try again. I probably came across as desperate as my world was turned upside down. He's not the type of guy to go out on weekends, do stupid things, he's always been a family kind of person and unfortunately our lives revolve around this house and the kids.

Fast forward 6 months and I cannot get over it. I think about it all day, every day. I google her. Facebook stalk. Dread going to local supermarkets etc in case I bump into her. It's broken me mentally. My Mum said this week ""bit you won"", I feel like the only loser in this situation. My partner has his slave/woman back who does absolutely everything, he hasn't had to make a single sacrifice and has come out of everything unscathed. The other woman probably still has her husband and is on to boyfriend number 34569. I'm here absolutely guffed in the head, how is that winning?

We were supposedly engaged before this, but partner has never had the intention to get married. When I found out about ""her"" suddenly he offered marriage but it's since been revoked. 

Trouble is, I cannot trust him anymore, as simple as that. He's now spending every spare second of his life gaming with online friends and I'm resentful of the time he's spending laughing and joking with them and I feel I deserve so much more from life

Can anyone relate? I think I know the answer, if I had somewhere to go I think I'd move out ASAP.

Here is my story, DDay was April 8th 2022, I found the messages on his phone and knew my life would never be the same. We have been married for 10 years and together for 14 years. I honestly never seen him doing this, I never seen any red flags even now looking back. Which just makes me feel stupid but his behaviour never changed. 

He is with the AP now so we will be getting divorced come April this year. And I’m ashamed to say it broke me, in ways I never thought possible. I developed PTSD to go with my severe anxiety and depression. I have to go the doctors every week to be weighed because I lost 16 kgs and I’m one step away from hospital and a feeding tube. I am also about to start EMDR therapy soon.

We have 3 children together 2 with special needs and 1 with complex special needs. He left all the parenting to me and when the one with complex special needs started smearing poo all over the house I lost my mind. I couldn’t do it all anymore and I withdrew from him and from the kids. He told me he could see me drowning and instead of helping me he jumped ship and bailed. 

Everyone on here talks about how the cheater wore a mask but is it possible to keep it up for 14 years? I feel lost and angry and sad.

6841,no idea what to do next,"Hi everybody. A few nights ago my husband left his old phone at old while he was out for the night. I've had suspicions for a while and his passcode was stupidly simple. I wasn't able to see a lot, but I was able to see his messages on one particular app going back several years. It looks like he's been talking to and occasionally meeting up with a woman I was specifically uncomfortable with. I had asked him to cut contact with her at the beginning of our relationship in 2018. I know he saw her in person at least twice a couple months after our wedding in 2020. 
I don't know for sure that they hooked up, but she's an ex so not sure what else to think. He took her up to his cabin and also went to her house.

He continues talking to her all the way to present day. She's in a relationship now. He seems to be bothering her. It's embarrassing to read. He is always trying to turn the conversation sexual and she doesn't seem into it. Eventually end of last year they moved the convo to Snapchat.

I'm ready to think about divorce because this comes on the heels of ongoing issues we've had. You can read my post history to see how well our ""open relationship"" has been going. Now I see he just wanted permission to cheat. I feel betrayed and like I don't know him at all. I have always been crystal clear about him and this woman.


I haven't said anything to him yet because I don't know what I want to happen. Have a counseling appointment tomorrow and might think about talking to a lawyer.


Has anyone else been through this where you don't know 100% that sex took place? Does it matter? Is this 'worth' considering divorce? I know he will say they didn't hook up.

I’m already so ashamed I don’t love myself enough to not want to still be with him and try reconciliation. 

But to be rejected after being betrayed? I’m such a fool. 

At this point I’m hurting so much more than I did and I have to be sober of all things to keep from self-harming again or going cuckoo for real. 

So I have to feel this pain and it’s so raw and I’m tired. I’m so exhausted from all of this. 

From hating him, to loving him then to be rejected while I’m literally on my knees crying desperately for him to take me back. 

I know it’s wrong and I know it’s a case of finding my self-worth and all that, but I just love him so much. 

I miss him like I’ve never thought possible and I don’t know how to cope. I’m running, I’m meditating, I’m doing all the breathing exercises under the sun but nothing is helping. 

It feels like I’ve been suffocating for the last two weeks and I didn’t know my heart could literally hurt this much too. It just wants to either give up and stop beating altogether, or beat violently out of my chest. 

To all the survivors, what legitimately worked for you to survive the worst of the storm when you were in the thick of it? I’m running out of things to try and I’m so desperate for relief. 

Could it be as simple as a holiday? Or superficial as a new wardrobe? Or should I push myself to write out all the gory details? Should I beg him harder?What helps so I can fight back against the intrusive self-harm thoughts. 

They have had a knack of catching me off guard these past couple of days and I can’t afford to indulge in them. 

Everyone keeps saying I need to feel what I’m feeling and give myself time and space, but it’s been two weeks of complete hell and I’m at my wits end. 

Sorry, I’ll end this rant now. I’m just having a weak moment I guess and could do with a hug, even if only virtual.

Update: I’ve been self reflecting a lot after last night’s behaviour and most of y’all are right. It’s coming from a place of still not having learned how to love myself again post-betrayal and break up. I was wanting the companionship I’m going cold turkey from more than I actually want him.

6861,He cheated while I was pregnant because he found me unattractive,"

So this was in 2017. I was pregnant enough to be showing. WS says he found me unattractive at that time and that led to him cheating on me 3x ( I think more) with his previous girlfriend. She knew all about me and that we were expecting. Yesterday is when I found this out, so I’m still processing a lot of this and feel slightly relieved that I have more of an answer than I did before. I’m so insecure now I don’t want him looking at me. I think I’m pretty, just not to him. He insists I’m pretty but it’s in one ear and out the other. Looks aren’t everything I know, but it hurts. I asked him if I had never gotten pregnant does he think he would have cheated on me and he says he don’t think he would have. He was crying and looked ashamed for whatever that’s worth. If anyone here has cheated on a pregnant spouse because she wasn’t attractive anymore could you please give me some insight ? Or anyone from the outside looking in, what do you think? He says he’s only ever done this while I was pregnant . I hate reality lately and have anxiety even posting this. Thanks for reading .

Edit for update : so after some of these comments and a calmer outlook my WS and I had a talk.  I came back to the question and asked him if the pregnancy/unattractive was a cop out or what the deal was. He said his original answer was a simple just because he was a cheater and that I insisted he had a better answer and didn’t know what to tell me so he just went with what I was offering up as a reason.

6873,Update. Have left for my home town with my babies ashes to put my life back together,"I didn't think I would write another post here, but I have had SO many messages requesting updates, I thought I may as well put an update in case this story is actually of any help to anyone. I am still finding myself perusing this sub on occasion and reading your posts and comments on other stories is helping, so I may yet stick around for that reason and post updates through the various stages if I continue to have people reaching out.

Just a quick update, my closest family and friends flew in after my darling girl died and  took over to do everything for me. They arranged the funeral and my father is now the liaison for my husband so I don't have to speak to him. We invited him to the funeral service (he thankfully stayed away from me) and I am keeping her ashes. My friends and family packed up the house (my stuff anyway) and we flew back to my home city yesterday (my stuff is going straight to storage) and I will stay with my father until I am ready to move out

My STBXH has stopped begging me to give it another chance (I think even he can't ignore his own role in me going into early labour and losing our baby) so it looks like the divorce should hopefully be simple. He has agreed to sell the house and split everything evenly and I want as little drama as possible.

Thank you so much to everyone who has commented and reached out and I'm sorry I can't get back to you all. It's just been such an overwhelming experience and I never realised how destructive cheating could be. I am in therapy to try and process the grief of losing everything, but losing my baby overshadows losing my marriage 100x over. The only hope I have is that in between the feeling of immersive grief and feeling utterly defeated, I do feel glimmers of determination to rebuild my life..   


Thanks again to this sub - I am so glad it's here to help us all through this. I know we are all struggling to rebuild after infidelity and I suspect it will be a long time for all of us - I appreciate everyone who has made it a little easier for me by sending messages of support. xx

If I'm not fun enough, tell me. But to feel like you're kept around because they benefit from you. Because you keep their cup full while yours is empty and they won't even put a few drops in.

That hurts. To know you have simple wants, simple needs and they choose to completely ignore them but fulfills the needs and wants beyond what you ever asked for, for someone else. They say they want a partner, so you strive to be that for them. Just for them to walk out on you with someone who has no honor, no dignity, no drive for success.

I'm battling with feeling worthy of someone who I feel is so worthy of me. This pain is so great that I had to tell someone. But I don't feel comfortable telling anyone in person. 

I'm so heart broken and I'm really trying to heal. The further I dig into what my life is, or was, the more I realize the depths of disdain he had for doing anything for me. Why did you marry me? If I wasn't who you wanted. If I wasn't good enough for you at my best or my worst.

I’m feeling so much and so little at the same time, it’s like I can’t even process what I saw. He feels justified because I’ve had a tough year between work, my dad disowning me, and feeling generally depressed and I’ve been distant. He was going to divorce me but decided to fill the void instead. Now we have to figure out how to move forward. We have 2 kids so it isn’t simple. I just feel like I can’t even begin to think about how to move forward right now. I don’t know how he can just go about his day today like nothing happened. 
I want to go off on her through messenger because she knew he was married and came to our house to hook up with him anyways. I want to put him on blast with his friends because I feel like he should have to suffer and be shamed by someone other than me. I just want to sleep and can’t. I want to go to work or get things done around the house, but I feel drained of every bit of energy. 
I don’t know. I just can’t seem to process it. I can’t even lie down in our bed because it feels so disgusting now. He ordered a new mattress when I told him that, but I don’t know if he expects that to be a magic eraser.

6891,New Years texts from my ex,"I was with my ex-husband for 7 years when we separated. He was cheating serially using dating apps. There was maybe 1 person he saw several times, but it seemed like it was more a series of ONS.

We were in the process of adopting from foster care when I caught him. My main focus in the process was maintaining the progress I’d made in attaching with my kids. They’d had several parents come and go from their lives. I was and still AM very anxious that they have as much stability as is possible.

I mourned my relationship…he was my best friend. But separation was a simple choice when his behavior threatened my kids placement in my home. Divorce was final in May! He only has rights to supervised visitation and calls.

He moved to the other side of the country and hasn’t called or visited in 6 months (Father’s day). He’s texted a few times to try to talk to me about our relationship. I remind him I only want to talk about the kids. I remind him he’s welcome to call them. He missed 2 out of 3 birthdays. No calls or letters. Nothing for Christmas.

Then on New Years, 3 AM, he texts me he still thinks of me always and hopes it’s a great year blah blah blah. I didn’t answer. But I’m so angry.

I still don’t understand how he could do everything he did. I don’t understand the choice to lie and cheat and walk away. I don’t understand not speaking to our kids for 6 months. I wish I could block his number and tell the kids …anything! Anything so I don’t have to keep explaining his absence and reassuring them.

I wish I wasn’t afraid to provoke him. I don’t want to tell him off or request child support or anything because he’s so unpredictable. I’m afraid he’ll try to move back to town and ….I’m not sure.

I can’t really manage to even feel very angry.

6892,"I don’t struggle seeing pictures of him, I struggle with seeing pictures of us. It is almost like looking at a unsuspecting murder victim with her killer.","Recently a new friend I made a couple of months ago wanted to see my wedding dress. I went through my phone and found a few.  It did nothing to me. It was just me and my mom in the store where we bought it.

She asked me if I struggled scrolling passed pictures of my ex. Again that didn’t bother me. She asked if she could see what he looks like. I pulled up a picture of us both together… and it hit me so hard.

I saw myself, but that person is dead. She was smiling and so happy. Proudly posing with her husband, the love of her life on holiday. Not knowing he was already in an emotional affair.

He smiles so big, it is so hard to know he was pretending already. He was planning to do what he did. The smile seems fake but all his smiles looked like that. Hindsight is 20/20

I felt so sorry for her knowing what was coming. Knowing how hard her world would shatter and how ‘not ready’ she was for that. I could see the trust and the contentment in her eyes. She was just happy with her life. 

I wish I could change places with her. I can handle what was coming. I have the life experience and selflove to live through that. She does not. She will naively step into that, hoping that he snaps out of it, crying and hurting herself. Wanting to die and just stop existing. Asking herself what she did to deserve this. Hating herself. Looking up at AP not seeing her for the bland sad little grey mouse she is. Thinking the world of an ex not even worthy to stand in her shadow.

But I should be grateful. Even as unprepared and naive as she was, she didn’t give up. She didn’t beg, she didn’t destroy herself. I am proud of that but I miss her.  I miss the simpleness and the effortless contentment she had. She was always a positive person even in the face of drama. That is why I am here today.

6895,Is this a breakthrough?,"TW: mention of r*pe

I’ve been an observer of this subreddit for a little over a year now. I do have to say that I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder so a simple “leave him” doesn’t do it for me. Nothing does it for me. Believe me, I’ve tried. I’m a prisoner to my own mental disorder. 

My longterm boyfriend cheated on me using social media. He would message LOTS of girls and try to get them to meet up. It never worked though. He’s not conventionally attractive, but he’s the most beautiful man on this earth to me.

We have months where we are doing great and we feel very close. That often gets interrupted by bpd episodes and just the fact that he cheated on me. 

Last week we had a big argument because he got a new phone and he turned off the notification banners so it only shows up as “notification” and he refused to change it. I just told him “I’ve stayed with you throughout all of this, I support you with everything. What are you doing for me?” And he looked me straight in the eye and said “I put up with you.”

I haven’t felt a single thing for him since then. We’ve hung out, but he clearly notes my disinterest. He’s becoming insecure and keeps seeking reassurance. Is it bad that I feel good seeing how scared he is to hear my answer?

If you don’t know about BPD, one of the biggest parts of it is an intense fear of abandonment. I’ve felt scared for the better part of a year. He is all I have. And I feel nothing. I hope I continue to feel nothing. I’m going to contact a therapist and make a plan to move along. 

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else was desperately trying to make it work with WS and then all of a sudden you were ready to move on? I’m nervous, but I feel a sense of excitement in my stomach.

6898,UPDATE: Cheating on my husband during a drunk one night stand,"Original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/7kn8gs/cheated_on_my_husband_of_10_years_drunk_one_night/ 

Hi everyone.  I was surpised when I checked my spam folder one day and found all these message/chat requests for an update on this post.  A lot of you had kind words- so thank you.

I'm really happy to let everyone know that we together, and are better than ever.  The first few months were extremely tough and emotional.  We talked openly and honestly about that night, about the past 10 years, about our future, about unhealthy drinking habits, our sex life, ect.  We talked and talked and talked.  We never seperated.  We also never went to counseling.  I'm sure counseling could have helped, but for whatever reason, we hashed it all out in private. 

We took a vacation 4 months after just the 2 of us.  That was a real turning point.  There was no doubt after that trip that we were staying together.  We were still best friends, like we always had been, and we knew it needed to stay that way. 

Several months after that we decided to try for another baby and now we are a family of 4.

A year after that we moved several states away and we're living a totally fresh new life.  The move really helped solidify that it was in the past. 

I don't mean to make it all seem simple because it wasn't.  It was hard and scary and the lowest point of our relationship by far.  Even when things started turning for the better, he didn't trust me for a very long time.  Sometimes in an arguement about else, this whole thing would resurface.  I've dealt with a lot of self-loathing. 

I'm extremely lucky to have a husband that sincerely loves me unconditionally, even when I don't deserve it.  I could have lost my whole life.  

I hope my story offers a little hope to those of you still in the trenches.

6899,"When this subreddit is right, they’re right","I’ve been in this apartment nearly 2 weeks now.  Still working on keeping my boundaries, mostly not reacting is my issue.  Sometimes I do verbal jabs at him.  Overall, my mental health has improved quite a bit though.  My son is happier too!

WS already telling me dates he will be ‘out of town’ for who knows what.  He just went on a 5+ day trip around the state with his AP.  His next date is to visit another out-of-state friend, supposedly because work is overwhelming for him.  WS says he needs a vacation.  I believe you guys warned me to be prepared as he steps out of his father role; so I am working on that.  He keeps telling me he’s not sure how he can find someone.  My default answer is care.com is the easiest way to find sitters.  But then he brings up the sitter unable to pick Liam up from school, which is tricky but I told him if he has a steady one then add that sitter to the pick up list.  All of these issues have simple answers.  Then again this is the guy who just found the post office after living here for nearly 3 years.

Basically he keeps making excuses, and is giving up some of his days with his son.  My therapist says don’t take my son for WS’s sake; he has to pay to be a single father etc.  So, I am sticking to that advice, despite his excuses.  I also remember what you guys have said, he doesn’t care if it inconveniences me, he doesn’t care about me.  He doesn’t like when it inconveniences HIM.  He didn’t do the same for me not even a week after being separated; I forgot Labor Day my son had no school and I work a minimum wage job so I couldn’t take off (on top of being new) and he didn’t try helping, I sought out help from my old neighbors and couldn’t thank them enough.  So, honestly, thank you guys.  WS’s  words are empty promises to me.

6901,"Husband ""Likes"" Female Coworker (He admits!)","In the last 2 months, I have seen evidence that something strange has been brewing up between my husband and a female coworker. Texts back and forth during work hours have become more humerous, friendly, bantor, and lots of emojis:/ The phone calls were becoming more frequent and always at the end of the day (usually a pattern right before he would call me). 

I started monitoring these calls/texts to let him know the pattern and that he really needed to set boundaries with her, at least on a professional standpoint. She wanted to drop off food to him on the 4th of July, while he was with his wife and 2 kids. He couldn't set the boundary to her to say , No Thank You. That's when he said he realized he may like her (from his account). 

We then go on a trip together and everything is great! Very pleasant, not many fights at all, no contact from her. Then we return and they start working together again. He lies when he goes out to work with her or carpool with her to patients homes (they are both nurses). He eventually tells her one Friday night after work hours and before she leaves on a 2 week trip with her fiance, that He Likes Her and ""please keep my life simple and say that you don't like me"". She of course says No and that she has her fiance. He then tells me that night and opens up! 

For the last week and a half, it has been hell for me (and the kids). So much hurt, betrayal, and lots of lack of trust! He is about to start working with her again next week. He claims that he does not still like her at all and that it was a big mistake. Should I believe him? What do you think will happen when she returns and they work close together again in their small team? Is it okay to monitor and give him stipulations to follow when she returns?? We are in counseling but it mainly discussed whether we are staying together or splitting up. I feel like it's much more complicated than that and there is no guideline for dealing with something like this. Does he still love me, even when he says he does?

6905,Feeling down..my ex left to live in paradise without saying bye to our daughter,"My dday was day before mother's day this year after I found out , I had NC with my exbf. He has limited contact with our daughter only through text with just a simple good morning until my daughter told me to block him a month ago because she doesn't want to have anything to do with him. I was starting to feel good about myself i started school, being more active, and stopped drinking..just anything that will make me heal faster. I'm really trying hard to heal.

 Then I got a phone call yesterday from my ex he said he moved back to our home town (which we left  and moved to a different state because of him neglecting our daughter). My daughter hates where we are living and wants to go back home (we both loved where we lived and were the happiest there)  but sadly it too expensive to make it on my own. I used to be a stay at home mom because he worked too much and we did have the help to take care our daughter.

The last time we talked before NC he said he's leaving the state because he hates it here, never liked and he got a better job offer but he was going to leave September. 
  
in the phone call he told me he already moved couple weeks ago and started his new job. He said he wants to make things right and get us (my daughter and I ) a place to live back home and he'll pay for it, it will take him a year to get a home for us . He wants to make things right with our daughter. He doesn't want to reconcile but feels bad about what he did. hearing him on the phone ( he sounded happier) made my heart break as if it was day after dday. I can't believe he left without saying goodbye to our daughter and a month before her birthday. Now I have to tell my daughter not only does he get to go back home but I have no idea when's the next time she'll see him. I know she wants nothing to do with him but I want her to have a relationship with him so she doesn't end up with daddy issues or hate me...it feels like all this progress I was making just got destroyed in just a few minutes. And I hate that he gets to go back home to paradise while I'm stuck in this place that I also hate. He's the one who cheated and now he gets to be happy...

6915,Just writing as an outlet. Happy birthday to WH. Sorry it’s so long.,"And I’m laying here looking for the perfect image or picture or quote to properly express my feelings tonight..and then i realize there isn’t anything that will suffice. Tomorrow is your birthday and it will be the first one I’m not around for since 2016. My heart hurts and I have conflicting emotions. So I come here to write just to have an outlet. I’ve been overwhelmed with work and travel with this new job, but even all that doesn’t completely deter the thought of you. How badly I wish that it did... the very last text I sent you, I meant with my whole heart. I’ll probably never speak to you again. So boastful of your affairs and your pride in knowing how much they would hurt me if only I ever knew the truth. Even after your spewing that venom my heart has not started to hate you. It only hurts for what I thought that we had. My wish for you is that one day, even if 30 years down the road, you see that you were loved, beyond all reason and all understanding. I would have gone to the ends of the earth for you. Even still, that wasn’t enough.                                                    I have irreparable damage thanks to you. Yet still I’m in  tears because I can’t even say two simple words to you. “Happy Birthday.” So I write it here instead and hope that you know that you’re thought about even though you don’t deserve to be. Even J. asked if he should text you because he had a memory pop up in his photos as well. I told him no, that we have to realize that you aren’t part of our family any longer. Another episode of tears followed by his head hung low and exiting the room. There’s no words to take the hurt away from him either so we both just do the best we can to make it thru the days.                               So all this was written because I’m drowning in thought. In a fantasy world, we would meet for dinner and not even talk about us. We would just be friends reconnecting over dinner. We’d talk about life, you’d have a fruity-girly drink, I’d have a mudslide or White Russian, we’d laugh, have dinner and then we would hug, I would tell you happy birthday and we would part ways. A lot of imaginary scenarios play in my head with you and I. That’s all our marriage was, a too good to be true fantasy land that I was niave enough to live in. Silly, silly girl....

6925,Afraid of being hurt again,"It has been more than one year and a half after the D day. I still think about him every day, I still dream about him often. We have no contact at all since one year ago.

I would like to say that I'm doing well. I have been enjoying the time by myself, focusing on my job and the things I want. I bought an apartment and I'm decorating it, etc.

I had a rebound relationship after him. Terrible guy, a narcissistic looking for a prey, and he also ended lying and cheating on me. However, that one didn't hurt that much because I wasn't in love with him.

The problem is now. After all these months of healing, carrying a PTDS because of it, I feel in peace. However, I'm starting to open myself again, and I'm using some dating apps (I would rather meet someone in real life, but with the pandemic that won't happen anytime soon). I find myself being just too picky, I like no one. Sometimes after a match, when the guy starts talking to me I regret the like.

These last days, however, I have been talking to someone that's interesting and we're starting to develop a connection. Yesterday I noticed that he updated his profile. New pictures and a presentation text. Of course he doesn't owe me a thing, but it somehow hurt. Even though our conversation is going well, he improved his profile to try to get more likes. He's not stopping even though we're getting along. And that simple act reopened the door to all my fears. What if I give him an opportunity and he just uses me? what if he ghosts me? what if he lies to me? Am I ready to have that pain back in my life? 

And then I realised that it is not that I'm fine by myself, it is that I'm hiding and protecting myself. I'm not as empowered and healed as I thought. I'm just leaving safely inside the walls that I had to build around myself in order to continue after the betrayal that broke me.

You preyed on me during a vulnerable time in my life. I was broken after years of trauma. I was looking for anything to fix me, because the damage was deafening. My vulnerability was visible, there is no doubt in my mind that you targeted me because of it. 
I was blinded by the love bombing, bread-crumbing, gaslighting, the little compliments, the hidden insults, the manipulation. All designed to keep me confused and questioning, just the way you like me. I was your supply. 
But here’s the thing. I’m no longer in that vulnerable state. I’ve healed and then some, despite your mental abuse and covert attempts to keep me down. I’m stronger than I have ever been and incredibly proud of myself.
I knew I shouldn’t let you back into my life when you popped back up a month ago, but I think I needed to learn this lesson 1 final time. 
You showed your true colors to me. Probably for the thousandth time, but this time everything clicked. Thank you for that. It made things simple.

6935,I never used to be this anxious,"It’s been about 4 months since I ended things with my nex. I’ve been slowly dipping my toe into dating. For the most part it’s been good! However I had a realization today.

My nex used to text me constantly. Long paragraphs too, in the beginning and throughout the relationship. Just excessively long and drawn out messages to prove a point or communicate a simple thing. He would text me over and over again, “I love you so much you beautiful woman” everyday in between work. Just constant texts. I became accustomed to them and really felt loved and cared for when he would text me.

Now I’m starting dating again and I realize most people don’t text like that. Yes when you’re first getting to know someone you might send paragraphs but even then life happens and we get busy and people might not want to be tied to their phones. I understand that, but my traumatized heart does not. It immediately thinks because a person hasn’t texted me that they’re mad at me, disinterested, ect. (I do also have to realize when people really just aren’t interested too)

I feel like I wasn’t like this before my nex. I never cared when someone texted me… and now… It makes me anxious when someone takes too long to text back. And of course I wonder.. was texting me like that all the time a method of control for him? To literally occupy all of my time and mental space? It doesn’t really matter but I had this realization today. My anxiety came from this pattern of love bombing and trauma bonding.

6939,"When I look back on the 4 to 5 years of my life spent being involved with him, it feels like I am looking back on a cursed time.","What began as an innocent, reciprocated crush from a doe-eyed and inquisitive younger man for a worldly and spirited slightly older woman had gradually morphed into a horrid, horrible abuse cycle of deceit, disrespect, and misogyny.

With all the intelligence and tendency towards logic I had, I couldn’t figure out for the life of me why I wasn't able to shake off the spell (curse, really) that bound me to him so strongly I thought I was losing my mind.

Nothing I did at the time helped me get over him. Not dating other people, not time away from each other, not blocking contact.

It took an incredibly cold splash of reality to the face for me that finally did it. And I didn't even have to figure anything out — he simply took off the mask and revealed himself.

I have realized now that the reason I stayed bound to him for so long was simple: I stubbornly believed that he, deep down inside, admired and respected me. And I believe he also knew somehow that this was the secret to keeping me captivated. Which is why when the news of his true opinion of me started to reach my ears, he tried hard to convince me that what I had heard wasn’t true and tried to appeal to my pride in seeing myself as a woman of reason (“you’re a scientist, aren’t you? Why would you believe I even said that about you?”).

To narcissists it is all about controlling how other people feel about them.

And I did love him dearly. He wanted that. But that love was based off the presumption that he also loved me. And I was under the impression that he loved me because I did not have all the accurate information — he intentionally kept me in the dark and hid how he truly felt, hid details about his secret marital life, etc. So when that turned out to be false — once I realized that he in fact did not love or respect me, it was over in a snap. Just like that, my feelings for him were poof, gone.

My life after narcissism is so very much different now. I no longer relate to the support groups and no longer lurk these subreddits.

6946,I wish I had known it was a form of sexual assault. I wish I knew then what I know now.,"For me the hardest part of healing is coming to terms with everything I didn't know before meeting my ex. At the time I hadn't even considered that someone would treat me that way. I naively thought there would be some lead up or perhaps a reason why people become abusive.

The first time my ex grabbed my breasts without consent was after 4 - 5 weeks of dating. Before this there were red flags (I didn't know were red) and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. We hadn't even been intimate and yet there I was questioning if he did it because I held his hand or because I kissed him, had I asked for it? He made so many excuses and summed it up as my fault. He used threatening language and I just gave in out of fear and desperation. This continued with sexual coercion, gaslighting, and treating me like I was worthless. Anytime I had clarity I'd try to talk about it, but he would give me the silent treatment, be vindictive, or ""punish"" with meanness. I've done research and realized he was the covert passive aggressive narcissist, so nothing was ever direct. He knew what he did was wrong yet was intentionally vague to confuse me. He even told me he ""always missed why I was upset"". People dismiss it and say he was just a f×××boy, but it seems deeper than that. The mirroring, playing the victim, and deflecting, seems excessive for a simple f×××boy. I should've listened when he said his mother had diagnosed BPD. 

I don't even recognize who I was a year ago. I wish I would've been more serious, less afraid, less desperate for love. During the ""relationship"" I kept trying to get him to see how his behavior affected me. He pretended to be unaware so I tried harder: got articles off the internet, explained myself 12 different ways... He knew he was abusing me before I did. Had I realized I was being assaulted I would've done something.

6954,Expectations of a healthy relationship when all you've ever known is the love-bombing of the N Ex.,"My N Ex husband was my first everything. I was with him since I was 21 and for 7 years until I divorced him in 2017. I was abused, you know how that goes.

I've been dating this new person since Dec of last year. We've only been ""official"" since August. I have mixed feelings because this is a very mature person, kind, centered, generous, respectful, but (and I quote) ""he shows love through actions, not words"". Since this conversation happened (many months ago) I've been trying to ""adjust"". I don't want to compare because I know my Ex was love-bombing me to continue the abuse cycle, and apart from that it's either ""all relationships are different"" or ""what works for a couple doesn't for another"". There's no reference for me to measure what this is.

My love language is words of affirmation. I've communicated this and he will throw in a compliment or a ""hello sexy"" every now and then. But this is obviously not his strong suit and I'm starting to doubt whether we're lovers or just friends. I have all this love to give which I express on the regular, I've put myself out there again, and I feel it's being met by a simple ""thank you"" and some smiles. Like there's a level of intimacy I can't open the door to, or that he's having trouble opening too. I don't know what it is and I feel bad about keep pushing the issue.

So back to the mixed feelings, how does one adapt to ""normal expectations"" after what we've lived and could all this insecurity be caused by the previous love-bombing of my ex?

6958,I'm so proud of me!,"Some quick background; my parents have an emotionally abusive relationship, which I always hated. So logically, I repeated that in my own relationship...

My soon to be ex-husband and I were together for 13 years, married for 10. Although looking back, none of it was ever healthy, it really got very bad after we had our daughter.

Simple things like making me apologize and beg for a hug in the middle of a panic attack, ""needing"" to go play hockey, even when our daughter was ill or in the hospital. Lying about stupid simple things. Lying to others where I could hear it, and telling me that he only lies to others, never to me... Making me lie for him at times. Almost missing the birth of his daughter (which was an emergency c-section, I was bleeding and had to take a taxi to the hospital alone, around midnight)... 

Anyway, I recently met someone and the chemistry was (is) amazing. 

Except; turns out he's in a relationship and has an 11 month old daughter. I'm not monogamous, so that fact alone doesn't bother me, but the fact that he misrepresented the relationship does. He made me believe that they were just together for the child but had an agreement that they could see others. But if that's true, then he wouldn't have to worry about me texting him when he's with them, or her finding out about me etc.

I almost fell for it again. Him saying ""I lie to her, but not to you, I promise...""

But I didn't. I told him not to come over tonight, not even as ""just friends"". Cheating is cheating, it doesn't matter if you actually have sex or not.

The chemistry was amazing. I like him a lot. I'm in love (and lust). And yet, for basically the first time in my life I picked my own morals over what someone else wants to convince me to do.

I picked what is best for me long run. Reality over easy to believe lies and deception.

6960,It's so quiet out here.,"Nothing prepares you for the silence you encounter when you break free. 

Once my mom realized that I wasn't going to swallow her manipulations anymore she convinced herself that I am a horrible daughter who doesn't care about her and now only contacts me out of obligation on Christmas and birthdays. That's it. Conversation over. I've been fired from my position, I suppose. 

Now that I'm free and independent there is literally nothing in my world to worry about. It's so... quiet. It's like I've been listening to angry death metal all my life and then someone suddenly switched it off. 

My boyfriend is honest and kind and makes my life better in so many ways each day. No one cares what I do, what I wear, who I hang out with, what I eat, what my plans are for the future. No one questions me, no one has unrealistic expectations of me, no one cares if I stay up all night or if I listen to my music too loud. I don't have to listen out for passive aggressive warnings or censor what I say or get screamed at. 

My life is quieter and more peaceful than a forest covered in snow in the middle of nowhere. 

My brain isn't used to this level of peace and quiet. It keeps thinking, ""Surely there is something you must be doing wrong. Let's think about all of the things you should feel bad about. Are you sure you're not a horrible person? Maybe your boyfriend secretly hates you."" 

I'm having a hard time believing that everything actually is okay. Could life really be this simple and honest and fair? Could I simply go to work, cook food, watch Netflix, be honest about who I am and make my own choices?

6965,Boyfriend (25) stopped talking to me (23) because of my question.,"
We’ve been together for more than 3 years now. We have a 5 months old daughter. 

Yesterday I had a very bad fever, due to my mastitis. For several days already I’ve been dealing with headaches and sore muscles. Even tho the only thing I wanted is to drop everything and lay down I still made his breakfast. 

For dinner I was making a pizza with chicken. I prepared the Yeats for the dough and then started  frying the chicken. He suddenly made a comment, why don’t you make the dough first? I was surprised, because it didn’t make much of a difference for me. We have a baby, so we have to do whatever we can as fast as we can, so while the yeast was in a bowl I started doing something else. I asked him why, he said never mind. 

Then I started preparing the trey I wanted to use foil and he said no use the paper instead. So I looked at him and asked if he’s watching me and waiting for my mistakes. (To be fair we had this argument 100 of times) I explained to him before that instructing me on everything I do makes me feel like I’m walking on eggshells. I’m scared to do simple things, because I feel like I’m being watched and I’m doing it wrong. I don’t mind kind advices. 

Anyways, since my question he stopped talking to me. He stopped showing any type of affection, didn’t make any eye contact. I asked him few times if we will just sit in silence now, he said no, like everything is fine. I went to sleep with the baby and he just stayed on the couch watching football till midnight. He came to bed didn’t say a word.

This morning nothing again. I asked him finally if he will give me silent treatment because of what I said, he replied that he can’t say anything, he’s just trying to help. Every time he’s trying to help that’s how I react. 

I’m feeling really sick and I’ve been feeling burnt out as a mother for weeks too. I’m starting to question whether there’s something wrong with me and I can’t take criticism or any advice. 

I even question whether this is big enough to cry about it. I tell myself that surely you get what you deserve in life and I must be as difficult to deal with for him.

Any advices? This leaves me so exhausted, I want to be my 100% when it comes to my daughter, but now holding her just makes me cry hysterically.

Please, be kind. Still having a fever and pretty much given up on any type of conversation with him.",yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
6969,am I being punished,"Disclaimer: This post is a [follow up](https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/ydep9w/is_my_boyfriend_right_to_be_upset/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from my previous post, in case you were wondering where you’ve seen this before. Thank you for your time. 

My boyfriend(M27) and I (F19) got into an argument recently because he was upset with me for turning my phone off completely for 3 hours. He gave me the silent treatment the entire day after our argument until last night we finally called and discussed it. He claims that if I was able to do exactly that and forget him for 3 hours that I don’t love him at all and that I don’t care for him. He says he’s now going to stop expecting things from me and from everyone since they all just disappoint him. He says my actions never match my words because since I never let him know what I’m doing all the time or am able to just leave the way I did through the phone that I simply disappointed him. I ended up apologizing to him and saying that it was entirely my fault and that I can do better, and if there’s any boundaries he doesn’t like me crossing to express those instead of keeping them in and not saying anything until last minute. I never knew he would have a huge problem with me turning my phone off that way, and for him to give me the silent treatment for an entire day felt like punishment. Now after the discussion he just agreed that we have to do better but that he needs time to “heal” and that he doesn’t feel good to be like himself. Usually wouldn’t a problem as simple as this be solved without it carrying on for the next couple of days? He did tell me he loves me in the end and that he doesn’t want me to cry or feel bad at all. But now it’s the next day and he’s not the same towards me and I’m still feeling extremely guilty. I have no reason to feel this way if I already did my part and took the blame yet I still do because he’s giving me the cold shoulder.

I swear I can’t have a simple conversation with him without him leaving and feeling like I’m attacking him to the point the issue doesn’t get addressed. He gave our son too much medicine for his age and all I was trying to tell him was the importance of reading the labels and how on top of that, he gave him the wrong medicine 🤦‍♀️. That’s it. No yelling, not condescending, or disrespect. Is this normal??? Does anyone struggle communicating with their SO because they always feel attacked? Is this part of their game?

When I communicate with him I have to follow all of these rules: I knock before I enter his room. I ask him if the moment is a good time to speak. I give disclaimer that I just gave a question to ask him. If he cuts me off and say “not right now” I stop what I am talking and walk away. The one time I didn’t do all of the above, I am flat out being disrespectful in his eyes. Sorry, when my child is sick, it’s hard for me to follow all of these stupid rules.

6977,Ex Made Me Sexually Insecure,"I’m a pretty simple person when it comes to sex. I don’t mind trying new things sometimes but I really see sex as a way to connect more than a gateway to fucking. And sex is the one time I don’t think about anything, so I don’t want to feel like I’m playing Twister by changing positions constantly. I’m not a young adult anymore. I have a bad back and I’m kind of a “pillow princess”, I like it to be as relaxing and easy as possible. Especially if I enjoy it, I don’t feel a need to change it if it’s enjoyable as is. 

My ex didn’t see it that way.

He constantly wanted to “spice things up” and made it very clear he enjoyed freakier women/sex.  It made me feel boring, like my vagina was broken because I was usually not ready for these things (because deep down I didn’t want to be doing them but was trying to not feel like I sucked by participating unwantingly) and just like I wasn’t enough. 

I’m so happy that relationship’s over, but now I don’t know how to pick my confidence back up.  I don’t want someone else to find me boring or unadventurous. I haven’t dated or slept with anyone in years for this reason. I don’t want someone else who’s hiding that they’re deep down unhappy with my performance. 

I have a ton of performance anxiety and I have been avoiding dating for this reason, but I’ve recently met someone I’m very attracted to and I don’t know how to bring this up and also how to relax my thoughts.

This has been very traumatizing for me and I can’t seem to get past it. And I have this inner voice telling me there’s no men who ACTUALLY enjoy basic sex, that they will always want more than what I want and if they can’t get it from me, they will cheat. I don’t want to keep avoiding men I like and sex.

6981,Simple mundane tasks become scary,"Putting the soda away in the pantry and turn to see my SO standing behind me... waiting, watching. My heart stops. I go into full defense mode. What? What does he want? What did I do wrong. How have I messed up putting groceries away?

“What?” I demanded. Tone was unpleasant anticipating the attack. The monologue of insults and criticism. Pointing out they ways I was stupid and useless for stacking cans.

Then I saw it. Confusion in my his eyes. “Just waiting to throw away this trash...” looking at me, wondering why I was upset.

I realized what I had just done. After 11 years with my husband, it has become second nature. Everything I did was wrong somehow. I was constantly a disappointment. I always messed up.

I just assumed that because my SO was there, that he was waiting to rip into me. I immediately went on guard. To shield myself from his insults. To take cover from the incoming criticism... but he has never done this to me.

He has been supportive. He has been kind. He has been good to me... but I reacted like he was the monster I married.

This is stupid. It was unfair for me to react like that, he has never been cruel to me. 

I’m in the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in, yet I still flinch when an arm is raised. I jump when he comes down the hall. I still put my shields up when he sees me doing chores.

Obviously I was unhappy with the progress because I wasn't opening up enough. But today I laid it all out, basically outlined our weekend in detail. What we argued about, what he said, what I said, etc. We talked more about the dynamics of our relationship. 

My therapist said one simple thing that opened my eyes when I recounted the things my husband commonly says in arguments: ""That's emotional abuse."" I can't stop thinking about it now.

I've been so confused talking in circles with my husband and has me convinced the somehow motherhood has fried my brain, making me incapable of understanding ""simple"" arguments.

I know how scary it can be... yet if he had hit me then it would make all these things I'm feeling more valid. I wouldn't be viewed with skepticism for calling my ex abusive. What he did to my son was not okay. I can rationalize that was unacceptable but I can't with how he treated me.

My sister compared my ex to Kilgrave from Jessica Jones, and how I can't get his voice out of my head. It's only been two weeks of me being gone. I have zero desire to get back with him again. But I can't shake all the things he said to me and feel like there's some sliver of truth in them.

I'm at a safe house right now with a few other women and their kids. I'm seeing them carrying on the best that they can, still going about their mom duties... and I just feel frozen, like I don't really want to make an effort or eat or do anything. Like I'm functioning on autopilot. 

I'm making all the phone calls I can to get prepared for my case, but I feel so lost about everything else. Even though it's really simple.

I used to be the master cleaner and made amazing home cooked, from scratch, meals. I had to do these things because my ex wouldn't usually clean and because he'd get mad at me and call me lazy if the house wasn't clean and dinner wasn't made when he got home. And if he didn't get mad that day, he'd bring it up the next day how I don't do anything.

This place is way nicer than I expected it to be and they have a lot of good resources here, yet for some reason I can't shake everything he's ever said to me out of my head.

All I hear in my head is him criticizing my weight, and then not wanting to eat. All I hear in my head is him criticizing my parenting. All I hear in my head is him telling me I sound simple minded and retarded and like I'm better than everyone else, and that's why no one likes me.

I feel the exact opposite. I feel lower than everyone else. I'm afraid to say anything because I'm afraid of sounding stupid. All I want to do is shrink and disappear and not draw attention to myself.

I honestly wasn't expecting that nor wanted him to get charged, I simply wanted an order to allow me to get my property and leave, he has had a prior order on him from an ex whom he grabbed by the throat while angry but that order wqs removed by his ex.

They’ve begun fighting on their back patio. Her room shares a wall with their home and she’s had to start wearing headphones to block it out. We’ve discussed the matter many times and I’ve done my best to explain. She asks why the wife lets him do it and I explain it’s not that simple. She asks why the police haven’t done anything and I’ve explained their limitations when the victim denies things to prevent things from getting worse. I’m worried for my neighbor and I’m worried for the toll this will have on my 10 year old. Is there anything more I can do to get the police to act even if the wife is denying anything is wrong??

I keep thinking about him, and all the good times we had. The good memories. I can’t even listen to the Jesuit I used to because every song reminds me of him. And it hurts so much.

Then I find myself getting so angry with everything that he did to me, our daughter and our unborn son. The things he put me through, the emotional and mental damage he has done.

Sometimes I find myself wondering if he’s okay. If he’s thinking about us and if he’s feeling guilty with what he’s done. 

Every single day, from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed he is constantly on my mind.

Some days I miss him. Some days I’m so angry with him. Other days I’m so torn up and so broken-hearted that I have to fight the urge to reach out to him and say I’m sorry and fight trying to get back together. 

And if that isn’t enough, my dreams are filled with him. Every night he is in my dreams in some way shape or form. 

Most are nightmares doing the things he’s done to us in real life or worse, others are sexual, and the rest is just me coming to him feeling guilty and saying sorry.

     It’s been a year since he last hurt me, and we’ve been separated and living apart since Feb 2021. I wasn’t able to financially leave before that, and he ended up leaving me for another woman- probably because I refused to have kids with him and couldn’t stand him touching me besides a hug or simple kiss for the past 3 years. It’s been really hard on me financially and getting a divorce has been dragged out, separating bills and still having to be civil towards him makes me feel like I’m still under his control.

He was over last weekend, we were joking around loudly talking over each other while watching a movie. There was a lull in the conversation, I got sucked back in to the movie, and my boyfriend suddenly continued it. I instinctively whipped my head around to look at him and froze in fear. He recognized what was happening, held me close and kept apologizing. He’s a sweetheart, he’d never hurt me and I’m genuinely not afraid of him… But I’m frustrated that I had a reaction when it hasn’t happened since my ex last laid his hands on me.

7013,I left off information on the police report for my DV case,"I left off information on the police report for my DV case. On 11/24 my husband came into our residence and started to trash the place after we had an altercation over the phone. When I tried to stop him he threw me to the ground twice and shoved me against the wall. When I attempted to stop him again, he attempted to pull his firearm on me. Moments later when he is trying to trash the closet, he actually takes the gun out the holster and points it at me after I attempted to stop him.

When the police came, I only told them that he attempted to reach for the gun but never the part where he actually pointed the gun at me the second time because I knew that the charges would go up and I as an idiot, was trying to protect him. He was only charged with simple assault and criminal mischief, but I'm certain that the charges would have been aggravated assault if I mentioned that he took the gun out the holster.

Now that the court hearing is soon approaching, I've decided that I'm going to tell the whole story for my safety. If I include the detail that he actually pointed the gun at me, will it be used in court even though it's not on the police report? 

PS. Please don't berate me for leaving information off the police report, at that time I felt like I was doing something right by protecting him.

7014,None of it was real…,"I had to go to the preliminary this morning for my ex. He was bonded out of jail after a very violent 3.5 hour evening. He tried to make contact which was a violation of his bond so I went to the district justice and the judge revoked it. Turns out, the no contact part of his bond wasn’t in writing and the PFA was not technically in place yet since he got out on a Monday morning before I even had a chance to file for one-so the district attorney agreed to reinstate his bond, and drop the strangulation charge as long as he agreed to plea guilty to simple assault and terroristic threats with intent.
We have a three month old baby girl together (I filed for custody today, and have a 2 year PFA in place) but Christmas is coming, and I can’t help but feel so sad and so heartbroken. He was so awful and I am relieved that my kids and I don’t have to go through that anymore or walk on eggshells everyday. I know that I am missing what I imagined or hoped he could be, and that none of it was real. But it was real to ME. I loved him, and wanted a happy, healthy, loving family with him. He ruined it for all of us. I’ve never experienced emotions like this. One moment I am happy and singing in my car, excited for what life has to bring now that I am free, and the next I am wishing we could go back to the good times. I miss watching tv with him in bed at night, I miss feeling him kiss me while I was half asleep as he left for work in the AM. I miss laughing and being playful together, and his hugs. 

I have met with a counselor through a DV non profit in my town, I didn’t like her much though, so I am looking for a new one.

7015,Ptsd is hitting me harder now.,"TW for physical abuse. I've been out of DV for 9 months. It seems now that I've actually been attending job interviews, studying, and dating ptsd seems to be worse. I wonder why? I seem to be able to attend most job interviews fine. Then a simple task this morning such as going to the petrol station to get a hot coffee was difficult. I do this all the time but today was difficult.

&#x200B;

There was a man who sounded like he was getting angry at the cashier. He wasn't screaming. I could just sense the tone.  I was looking through the reflection to see if he had anything in his hand. I was waiting it out, then just ended up leaving my hot coffee there. Like the waiting and the anxiety of if he was going to do something I couldn't even deal with. I felt trapped in there and thought the door wasn't going to open but it did. I came back to the petrol station once he was gone. Nothing even happened while I was gone. Nothing has happened to me at a petrol station. Only with the men I've been in relationships with.

&#x200B;

I don't know how that was even a trigger.  I've also been going about my day and I can feel my abusers hands on my neck still and I actually feel it. It feels like it's actually happening. I'm in therapy and I'll be letting her know about this.

7026,Questions about preliminary hearing and sentencing,"Hello, this is my 2nd post in here. My abuser was arrested last Friday. My preliminary hearing is Monday. I am beyond freaked out. I looked at the public docket for his case. He is facing F2 Strangulation, M2 Simple Assault and S Harassment. According to the docket, he denied counsel?

Public Defender reuested by the defendant? No

Why? Does this mean he denied an attorney? Why would he do that? I was told that Monday, I will speak to the DA and arresting officer about what I want to see happen. I want him to get help. I definitely do not want him to be charged with a felony. I want to see him plead guilty to a lesser charge and have the felony dropped. Yes he did what he did but locking him up without therapy or counseling will not help.

Why would he deny a public defender? Does this mean the arresting officer and DA will just meet with him directly? He has absolutely no money or family or friends. I am trying to figure out what he is planning. He knows my personality and nature, I am sure he knows I will be advocating for him not to get in trouble and to get help. I am concerned that he will be locked up, get out, have no job or car or phone or place to live (he has no family or friends, only me, he has said it a hundred times before) and come to me. He needs a chance to get his life together. He has a previous charge for simple assault that he did 1 year for, got out and violated the PFA and went back to jail. So I know he won't care if he is told not to come to me. My goal is for him to be able to get back on his feet, which will ensure he will leave me alone.

I was told that there are programs in my state (Pennsylvania) that may work with him, such as a halfway house and job assistance, etc. This is all so stressful. He is also $2k in arrears for child support. He lost his job and had been trying desperately to get caught up. Will he immediately go back to jail for the arrears? I was told they are on hold while he is incarcerated. But then what? I was told that he will be given a chance to get caught up with the arrears before being put in jail, but someone else told me the opposite.

So basically, why would he deny an attorney? And does anyone know if these programs for housing and jobs are real? And do they work? If they mandate counseling, how can he get to the classes without a car or job or house or phone? Will the arrears be paused until he can get settled?

7027,“Triggered”,"I hate to even use that word.
I’ve been out almost 2 months and I’ve been having issues with a particular friend who’s behavior has been triggering to me.

My ex tried breaking into my house multiple times while I was home. He would go window to window, try to get into the metal screen door, and knock or bang on the screen.. he would go thru a series of these in no particular order.
I’ve told everyone I’ve invited over to call me when they arrive and not to knock on my screen door because it makes me jump out of my skin.

This was a simple instruction to follow for everyone except this one friend. I’ve had to remind her more than 5 times and she still does it. He had a very specific of banging on the door and it’s clear to me she mimics it. I’ve gotten very upset about it and she just behaves like a child who got caught stealing cookies.. clearly does not feel bad.

This person also will blast my Facebook page with dumb break up and ex boyfriend memes, and inspirational self help quotes. I feel like she’s airing my dirty laundry and delete the posts. But then I am questioned, why did I delete her posts and then I’m told that I am “too sensitive”.

I know it might sound silly but it really gets to me sometimes.. it’s been a trigger for me to start missing him, to self harm (cutting, drinking excessively, breaking things) and to isolate.

7028,Having flashbacks,"Hello everyone. I’m looking for advice for those who have long since left their abusive situations but still find themselves thinking about it or having flashbacks to a certain bad night, etc. I’m currently in a healthy, loving relationship with my current partner and he is fully aware of the abuse that I went through while with my ex. It was mainly emotional and mental abuse but he did become physical more than once. I feel like I’m having trouble trusting my partner in certain situations or finding myself hypersensitive/ quick to react to otherwise simple things. For ex . My current man had a towel and playfully rolled it up and hit me on the butt with it as I passed by. (Like in a locker room) It was a funny moment and not malicious at all but for some reason I got so upset bc it reminded me of how my ex would continuously hit me with rolled towels bc he thought it was funny, despite me asking him to stop. Those incidents happened over two years ago, before I even knew my current partner, so I’m just upset and embarrassed that I allowed my ex to affect my present. It’s very confusing for me bc I thought I was over him, yet I’m being triggered by small things like this more often.

7035,It's starting again. I'm afraid he'll kill me.,"I have just recently moved back to my parents house. This wasn't a choice made easily. I couldn't afford my own place without roommates and mine were unfortunately kicking myself and my boyfriend of 3 years out.
I was scared to move back. Every night I woke up in a panic of childhood terrors. A constant fear I've dealt with. My father being majorly guilty. He has physically hurt myself and my other siblings for years. Then it became mostly anger and yelling. That I thought I could deal with. Although yelling from any one to this day sends me into a panic.
I've been home for just over 2 weeks now. I found out I was pregnant soon after moving home. This was wonderful news for me since I was told I wouldn't be able to conceive. My boyfriend, who moved into my parents with me, was ecstatic. We are both in our 20's and only needed a month or two to save up enough for our own place.
It seems this good news had to be followed by unfortunate circumstances. My dad's anger is worse than ever before. He shoved me out of a chair. Why? Because someone wrote on a piece of paper that was his. I didn't do it, but that didn't matter. He called me a liar and disrespectful. Mind you, my father doesn't know I am pregnant. My mother asked me not to tell him. She witnessed the attack. She did nothing.
That's not even the worst. Being hormonal and luckily not having complications with the stress, I was crying over a very silly argument I had with my boyfriend. Apparently my crying was too loud and upset my father. I had to run upstairs from screaming. He was choking my boyfriend and slammed his head against the wall until my boyfriend broke free. We spent the next hour with police taking our statements. My father was taken away. However, the bail was set low for only simple assault since my boyfriend didn't lose consciousness. My mother bailed him out after only another hour.
I was able to get some basic things and have spent the night at my boyfriend's parents. They won't allow us to stay another night I'm sure.
I'm afraid for my life and the life of my unborn child. This stress scares me. I'm even blaming myself for everything. The police can't do anything. My mother enables him. I have no where else to live right now. I can't go back to that house. I fear he'll kill me.

7036,5 Countries and Counting,"I'm running and I am so tired. I have one last step to take but it has become the hardest to take, not because I don't want to but because I am out of tricks. 

Back story: I moved to a foreign country with my husband and children. The abuse got worse. I ran to the police for help who put me in a women's refuge until I could get my passport situation figured out to go home. 

The only problem was I couldn't get emergency passports to go back to my home country because of the Hague Convention. If I went home to escape being hit, cussed out and to get my children away from being slammed against furniture without my husband's permission I would go to jail for International Kidnapping regardless of the fact I had only been in the new country for a few months. The Hague is a grey shade no lawyer wants to touch with a 10 foot pole. I couldn't get one without spending almost $125k, I needed to apply for a Leave to Remove order from the courts: a process that could take 2-5 years. I was homeless. As an immigrant no one wanted to rent to me without a massive downpayment and a co-signer. My visa had me locked out of benefits. I had no choice but to go back to my abuser.

We worked out a deal where we would return to our home country and he would do anger management therapy. We would attend couple's therapy in another (non-Hague Convention) country. We would go on grand adventures just like we use to do before my life became a living hell of eggshells and bruises. I didn't want adventures, I just wanted to get home. 

All these beautiful locations, all these great experiences and I couldn't enjoy any of it. I was too busy running escape plans in my mind for each and every new situation. I was too busy measuring his mood and defusing escalations. I ran again once on our trip in the non-Hague country, only to realize while on the plane that I wouldn't be able to get a visa for more than a few years in that country and would eventually be facing the same kidnapping charges once it expired. I only had a few more weeks, I told myself. I could do this. 

5 countries later I am finally in my home country. But he has locked down tight on me. I am no longer out of his sight, I have no phone access. I have no idea how to get to safety. Something as simple as finding a cop to get an emergency restraining order is a 2 hour walk from where we are.

I had evidence and the police ended up taking the choice away from me and charged him with simple assault and domestic violence charges. I even told him I would have to do it if he didn't leave, since he'd threatened to kill me and himself multiple times over the weekend and had a gun he had hidden from me. I know he brought this on himself but I feel so guilty. He's a veteran who's never been on trouble with the law. I even reached out to his family and told them I needed help so I didn't have to go to the police, and they said they couldn't handle him either and suggested I call the police on him the night I was ""accidently"" pushed. I am so sad right now. Sad thinking about where he is and sad knowing this is the end of something that could have been beautiful, or I thought it could anyway. But now we can start to heal and move on, I'm worried he's going to do everything he can to try to destroy my life but pretty much everyone is aware of how he is at this point, so hopefully he isn't able to do much damage.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred
7049,He said “yes I am upset! I had a long day moving our things into a storage. It’s so frustrating when you ask me for help with our baby. You know I just wanted to lay cozy in bed”,"Mind you, I only asked him to find me a towel and to cuddles with our 18 week old to sleep…… 

The towels I needed him help with because he placed them in a space I didn’t know and I was finishing up bathing our baby. Which became very upsetting that he had to get up off the bed to get a towel and when he looked he remembered he took the bag full of her clean + new towels to the storage today. 

*backstory I got my menstruation for the second time during postpartum AND! Let me tell you, I have never felt such crazy pain and cramps during menstruation like post pregnancy periods while exclusively breastfeeding*

After getting our baby dressed, made sure she was full, burped and rubbed her belly.  I felt some intense cramps so I asked him to rock her to sleep because I just couldn’t. He did it with the most plain face, cold, annoyed energy ever and he kept getting upset with her for putting her hand in their month (that is apart of development, it’s okay that they does it) he claims it’ll be a bad habit. (As a new mom who loves her baby… this hurt me the most, she was looking at his face for connection and he just couldn’t/wouldn’t/didn’t want to give it to her) 

Arugh, this may seem small compared to physical abuse that narcissistic  inflict, but the emotional & mental is real. The worse part is the hatred towards children even babies; it’s painful. 

He finds it annoying doing simple father acts yet won’t let me be a single mother because he says “no other man will raise his child” but really what raising is he doing if he gets annoying with simple acts of helping?

7053,I can make everything “better” 100% of the time…,"I learned, months ago… maybe longer… that no matter WTF BS thing, I’m being blamed for, whatever is “causing” the argument… No matter what’s causing him to threaten divorce, say I am crazy, or must be using drugs, say he hates me and I’m worthless… 

It literally doesn’t matter what the argument is about, or how mad he is (100% max anger every time right) …. But if I decide I want or need to get passed the anger, the stonewalling, if I just need things to be normal, for any reason, and whether it be 1 minute or 1 week later… I can make it all go away, within minutes. 

It’s amazing to me. At the risk of sounding ridiculous, I’ll say that I don’t really do anything wrong - and I mean that and trust most of you will understand that when I say he’s “mad”, it definitely doesn’t mean I am to “blame”, or that I did something wrong. Because literally almost 100% of the time, he’s “mad” and MAX MAD… because it was me, who got upset… that HE did something “wrong”. I’m sure most of you get it.

Once I stopped beating myself up, for not being strong enough, or not able to leave… (yet)… I realized, that for my own sanity, I can simply make his anger go away, with a few simple words.

It’s amazing that an issue can be divorce worthy, but, if I just say that I would really like to move forward…. I hate arguing.., I love you…. Let’s not do this, let’s be happy…. i mean it doesn’t matter but if I hug him, give a few kind words, he is literally  jumping at the chance to move on and be “normal” again.

So, pretty much as long as I’m massaging his ego, with kindness… love… he’s all good. Logical communication, reiterating literal facts, or trying to work out some kind of agreeement, or compromise… etc. not so much. But drop it all and go straight to love and happiness… ABSOLUTELY.

Any one else notice this?

Not that I needed it… but just more that supports the idea that even he knows I’m not actually “wrong”.

7065,Is my husband a Narcissist?,"My family and friends think my husband is a narcissist. For a long time even before we got married my husband hated me hanging out with my family and friends. He says I don’t barely spend anytime with him but when he’s back from work or he has a day off he is on the PlayStation for several hours or all day. I try to arrange movie nights in or date nights but he doesn’t feel in the mood. So when I do go out with other people it looks like we don’t spend anytime together as a couple but he spends more time on the console than with me. He kicks off with simple things such as: 
- We can cross over with us having different joh hours to each other so I sometimes pre-made a dinner for him to have when he gets in from work before I go to do my shifts and he refuses it saying that it’s not a hot/fresh dinners and he doesn’t want it. 
- If we take the dog for a walk he shouts at her a lot because she sniffs too much of tries to roll in mud :( 
- He barely helps with the house, I do all the finance, cooking, most of the cleaning and DIY. 
He thinks I’m a nag when I ask for help even if it’s to open a jar or take out the trash. When I don’t ask regularly or everyday. 
- Whenever I talk to him when he plays he finds me a distraction and a cause to lose against people he’s versing online with, so when I try to go out he hates me leaving and finds me selfish for leaving him home alone. I just thought giving him a few hours to play alone would solve the issue of me being a distraction. 
- He’s annoyed that we don’t have a regular sex life because I’m never in the mood due to him being so negative. I confronted him about this but he said “I will only be more positive as a person if we have more sex” :( 
- Last weekend I was about to leave to see a group of friends I haven’t seen in 5 weeks. We preplanned it and he was aware of it as I was about to leave he said “If I find out your going out again next weekend with friends or family I’m going to message them and tell them that you ain’t going. This was a new thing and he has never stepped to that level before so hearing that shocked me. 
I haven’t been happy for a long time and I feel like a Cinderella, doing everything and whenever I go out to let my hair down he makes me feel bad before, while I’m out and when I get home from the day outs I have with others.

Flash forward years later… I just realized my husband most likely has it; but a different kind. His father, without a doubt.

7083,I 20F have been with my bf 20M for 3 years but I think he’s too childish,"Hi so my bf calls me and asked if I wanted to do a movie watch party with him at night. I agreed and suggested a movie to watch. Later he calls me and we try to look for that movie on our streaming platform but looks like I mistakenly thought that movie was available but looks like it wasn’t. Then he shows so much attitude, My bf says “you had one job. I’m leaving now I’m going to watch YouTube” I was like what are you serious we can just find another movie. He said no and I was like ok whatever and hung up the call. We haven’t talked since then for a day. He has blocked me on Instagram. How childish can a person be like seriously?? Just pick another movie to watch. Do you think I should text him and ask him what’s wrong? If so, what do I say? I feel like I shouldn’t, he is the one who always likes to play the silent game and he never reaches out and speaks up on any problems he has. He seems to make such a big deal over little things like this. I’m not in the wrong right? We’ve been together three years but it hasn’t been that great recently

7091,I'm  feel like I am not good enough for my boyfriend  and feel like I am too dumb and always embarrass myself. How to stop feeling this?,"

  
My boyfriend Jake and I have only been dating 3 months but we have known each other for 12 years and share the same group of friends. We've always had a flirty, teasing friendship and he brought up the idea of us dating. Needless to say our group is shocked but not surprised lol
  

  
Anyway, I've always felt like I am not good enough. He has his life together; nice condo, good stable job, handsome, nice big supportive family, smart, has a nice car. Where as I still rent a shitty studio apartment, my job is okay, I'm pretty if I have makeup on, and I don't have a large family. My mom died and I don't speak to my dad anymore, I also don't think I'm smart, in fact I'm a slow learner, and I don't own a car. He's always dated really pretty girls who have their life together and its really hard to not compare.
  

  
I feel like I'm just always embarrassing myself in front of him, which always involves intelligence and confidance. We were playing a dice game and because I am overthinking I just simply couldn't do the simple math of adding the dice numbers together quickly enough, or I'd just blurt out ""11"" hoping that was it and he's like ""no 12"" and I'm like right haha. Or just last night we were coming up with ideas for a party and I was typing them into my laptop. He said a word that I knew what it meant but I couldn't figure out how to spell it and spell check was giving me nothing so I started to type the word into google and just clicked the first result which was ""\_\_\_ meaning"" again I knew the meaning, just needed to see how it was spelled. I went to the bathroom and gave him my laptop to keep typing and i guess he was about to type somethign into google and hes like ""haha looked up the meaning of \_\_\_"" and I was so embarrassed. He didnt say it in a mean way, more of a teasing way and I was like ""I knew what it meant I just needed to spell it!""
  

  
Anyway, I feel like I'm just too stupid and not good enough. I'm constantly on edge that hes going to break up with me already despite coming out as offical to our friends not long ago.
  

  
Does/do anyone else have this problem within themselves?

7092,Struggling to maintain relationships,"Struggling to maintain

I (19F) am currently in a relationship with (50M) i knew it would never work out but hoped at least it would last a bit longer. Unfortunately or I guess fortunately we havent passed the three month mark which means when i break it off i hope at least it wont hurt so much. The thing is ive seen so many posts about people who keep getting broken up with. But i feel as though in my full fledged offical relationships i am the one breaking it off. Its like i get so intensely wrapped up in people and they seem so perfect to the point where my own mind is fooled. I think i tend to place everyone above me on a mental pedestal but when it comes to true vulnerable relationships i can become quite critical. It goes from loving their confidence to absolutely hating their loudness. Those traits i used to place so highly end up being the thing i despise most. Im terrified. im so scared of being heartless and awful. Weirdly im often described of as being extremely emotive because i tend to be a doormat and let people walk all over me. I’ve had friends very clearly use me for personal gain and continue to provide because i know they never mean to be malicious but their situations are difficult. So then why when someone actually treats me right and shows me love do i completely close up? And its not close up like im simply withholding and could be shaken off with a simple dont worry about it. But instead the minute im loved i take it for complete granted and take liberties like somewhat suggestive talk with people at work and simply not showing the same care that i receive. Like i will literally bend heaven and earth when i have a crush but lo and behold they like me? Then they suddenly frustrate me to no end. I always tell myself i have morals therefore wld never go too far but i just don’t understand why can i only love when not feeling fully loved back. What is wrong w me 🤦‍♀️

TLDR: I cant keep relationships because the minute people actually care i lose interest and become selfish without intending to",irrelevant,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
7093,My (27F) boyfriend (29M) still has his ex's nudes on his phone.,"Yes, you read that correct. 

I was scrolling through his album to find another picture of him that I like when he pulled his phone out of my hand. The damage was already done though. Some of the nudes were simple while others were much more explicate. 

I asked him to delete them, as they made me very uncomfortable and sick but he refuses. When I asked him why, he said that it was for the memory, and that he wanted them there to remember. He said that once they were gone, he would be afraid that he would forget about that time in his life all together. 

I didn't want to fight about it, we haven't even been dating for a month so why am I to act as the 'crazy girlfriend'? I've had horrible, traumatic relationships though and it's hard to shake off those habits in a new relationship. I do like him a lot, I feel very safe with him. I can't stop thinking about those pictures though and I'm absolutely spiraling over the thought of him jerking off to an ex and not me.

I really don't know what to do. I don't want to break up with him but now I feel extremely insecure.

7094,Just found out that my (26F) boyfriend (27M) is yet another desperate guy in IG model’s DMs and I’m mortified,"
Learned that just over a month ago. He (27M) asked me (26F)  to charge his phone while he was having a shower, so out of habit, I grabbed his phone and started to close every app that was running on the background before plugging in. And for the record - we were ALWAYS open to use other’s phones type of couple. 

And I saw a very friendly message translated to our language from french on translate. Got suspicious and checked his translation history. 

“You are the most beautiful thing ever created, pure elegance. I feel charmed by seeing you with your killing grace even on a simple screen.”

“I feel fascinated every time I see you, every time see you I feel like I want to cry because of your unique purest existence.”

Now, I did certainly not receive those messages which were translated to Russian. So I confronted him in tears. Turns out those were for a russian model. 

In our relationship of 2 years, I have never received any compliments from him despite me begging him to at least lie to make me feel better. The funniest thing is that he actually approached me the first place because he thought I was too pretty. Now here we are. 

I mailed the russian model to see if he’s telling me the truth about him only messaging once and asked for screenshots. She gracefully agreed and helped me by sending them. 

Nope - he messaged her multiple times. 

So yeah. He was just another desperate guy in a stunning model’s DMs that will never be seen. 

Part of me thinks that this is a non-issue but other part of me aches for the girl that cried for the past 2 years for a single genuine compliment. 

He definitely changed his behavior after this situation but I cannot stop thinking about those messages. Was I not worthy enough? 

How can I move past this? I can’t seem to get over them or look at him without an underlying disgust. 

TL;DR: my boyfriend of 2 years basically wrote poetry for a model’s beauty over the months while he never complimented me despite me stating how upsetting it is many many times.

7096,How to get over a relationship that ended so suddenly?,"I (F23) was in a relationship with my partner (M26) for 2 years. Earlier this week they broke up with me and I’m really struggling to accept the reason why. 

Without revealing too much out of respect for them, they’re going through an extremely tough time right now. I completely understand that our relationship would’ve had to have taken a step back while they worked through these issues (which I was fully aware would have taken a long time!) but instead of allowing me to stay and support them they broke things off instead… 

I was fully prepared to do whatever I could in order to support them and I never even got the chance to. I’m just so confused as we were so close, I can’t understand why I’ve been cut out of their life so suddenly.  

I was so in love with them. We had made so many plans for a future together and it feels like a switch was flicked and the relationship was over just like that. 

Anytime we had issues in the past we were able to talk and work through them. The past month was rocky for us, it felt like life was throwing so much at us at once but I really do think we could’ve worked through it. It wouldn’t have been easy but it would’ve been possible. 

It really hurts as last week it felt like things were going back on track. There was still a lot going on in both our lives, but we were able to spend a couple days together that were just fun, the first time we both felt we could just relax together for a couple hours at least. And then it just crashed in 24 hours. We took a week apart to give ourselves time to assess ourselves. And then it ended with him breaking up with me. 

I feel so lost. We really loved each other which is making this even harder. We still love each other. But we just aren’t stable right now. He offered to connect again in a couple months to give himself time to work things out, but he said it couldn’t be romantic. I had to decline, as I knew I’d never be able to get over him if he came back into my life only as a friend.

It was just so sudden, and I don’t fully understand the reason why it ended, and I never will understand it. This would’ve been so much easier to get over if it was a big fight over something, but it just wasn’t as simple as that.

How can I get over this when I truly believe that I could’ve supported him through this rough patch?

I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years I would say I was pretty cool before him I did all these cool things went to all these unique places ect but then a year ago I realized I had a shitty job/career and went back to school. My boyfriend does not go to school but does have a career. 

My boyfriend is so cool he does things that are super cool to me such as fishing. He has all these cool pictures with these big cool fishes he also plays on a team sports and has all these nice friends sometimes I’m just jealous of him that he has such great skills, fun hobbies and friends while I don’t anymore?..

I know what everyone is going to say. Go get a hobby. Go do cool things. Go find friends

If it was that simple I would.

 Friendships do not come to me easily I been told I’m intimidating even though I really try to be friends with them nothing comes from it and it seems like people my age are just too busy with life 

I’m in school and full time work and it so hard to even try to have a hobby or to even do something!  

It’s so hard to be hyped for someone who had a great day while I had school in the am work in the pm and staying up to studying pass midnight 

It’s always work, school, workout it’s a 360 circle for me I feel like a loser? 

Our relationship is great tho I feel like he could be with someone cooler than me? He deserves a fun great life but duuuuccckk me I want to go back to having a life too

7104,I (F32) feel like I will never meet someone who accepts me for who I am.,"I was recently told by the man (36) I was dating he no longer wanted to see me (after a month of dating). From what I gathered, it sort of seemed like a personality clash. But this isn't the first time this has happened, or the first time a partner has told me I'm ""too much"".

  
I can be a gregarious, goofy, animated person when given the right social setting. Many of my friends and coworkers tell me how funny they find me, and how great of a person I am.  
It hurts to hear them say things like that though because if it were that simple, I wouldn't be struggling in the dating pool right now. I can't turn off my personality. I know when to be serious, when to be quiet, and I can read social cues. 

  
But I can't help but think ""is it me""? I just don't feel like anyone can not only match my energy, but also just let me be myself without finding me weird / annoying / too loud.

The first conversation i had with him about breaking up, we sat in his car for 4 hours, him telling me that i don't have a reason to breakup with him and i have no reason to be unhappy with him, Told me we wont leave the car until i say why i'm unhappy. This conversation was probably about 3 months ago and the feeling of being unhappy has come back.  
We also had another conversation months later about the same thing, me being unhappy. i didn't know why I felt this way, because he was such a good guy, i felt terrible that i felt this way. If there's nothing wrong with him then why am i unhappy? I couldn't give him a reason why i was unhappy so i made excuses and reasons that weren't true so i could break up. He called me delusional and said i was making up problems in my head. I wanted him but i also didn't. I feel like i can't leave him, i feel like i'll regret it. hes a really sweet person and i can't think of anything bad about him. I know the problem is me. I feel bad for letting this relationship go on but also i feel like he convinced me that i was wrong and my feelings were not valid. I don't know what to do.  
TL:DR - I don't think we're right for each other. I'm not happy and it's as simple as that. He believes there's more to it than that but there's not.

7110,"Dating & intimacy are giving me the ick, but I’m also feeling ready to move forward.","TL/DR: I’ve been feeling numb to any kind of intimacy and it’s starting to make me feel depressed. Have you dealt with a season of life like this?

28f, I live alone in a wonderful big city apt, coupla dogs, a great job… and I’ve been purposely single for the past few years with the occasional fling or situationship peppered in. Pretty normal couple of years to be fair. After my last *big* break up in summer 2020, I figured it would be fun to try a few intentional dates and so I have.

Recently starting seeing this guy and  it’s been great! Lots of shared interests, a comfortable level of chemistry, lots of respect. I was open from the beginning about not looking to go in any direction quickly and the relief I felt when he confirmed the same was overwhelming. 

Not just with this new guy, but with every guy I’ve dated in the past 6 months or so; I want to sleep alone, I don’t want to hold hands, I don’t want to be intimate in any capacity. 

I know emotional/physical intimacy is part of the vulnerability in relationships, I’ve craved it previously, but now it feels like that part of my brain is missing. I don’t want someone in my bed, or a dinner partner, I’d probably die of embarrassment before introducing anyone to my family. Even seeing pictures & videos from a friend’s recent vow renewal had me feeling the absolute ick over a simple public embrace.

7111,I(23F) confessed to my BF (23M) about going through a depressive episode and now I feel more lonely than ever,"We (F&M 23) have been together for 3 yrs now. I suffer of depressive episodes of different intensities. Last time I had one this bad was about 2y ago, so already having gone through one I know what to expect this time. It's been going on for 2 and a half months now. 

Abouth 1 month in, I sat down with my BF and told him what's going on. I talked to him about how the symptoms manifest, lack of motivation, having no interest in things I used to love, nonexistent libido etc. I told him what he could do to help (what i thought would help, I'm not that well educated on this), things like checking in on me and trying to get me out of the house. I also warned him that this period will last a while. At the time I felt like he actually listened.

Two weeks had passed since we had that discussion and one day I went over at his house to watch a movie and afterwards he tried to initiate sex. I told him I'd prefer we stick to making out and then he asked ""are you sure? we haven't done it in a while"" which is true, we haven't, but he knew the reason why. I told him I felt ashamed for telling him no and also kind of embarrased, but that the situation I made him aware of 2 weeks prior hasn't changed. He then proceeded to ask me how I've been feeling and that was the moment I realised that he hadn't actually checked up on me since the discussion, which left me a bit heartbroken.

His attitude towards this makes me feel very lonely. It's always been difficult for me to open up to someone, and having done that took a lot of effort. I wish it would've helped, but right now I feel like it didn't. It's like we never talked about it, like it never happened. How should I go about this?

7119,F24 confused after he (M32) brought me to his parents' and ghosted me. Any logical explanation?,"Hey, hope you guys can help this confused girl (me) out. 

In a networking drink, I (24F) noticed a guy (32M) eyeing me all evening, so I came by for hellos. We talked briefly, and before he left he asked to exchange numbers.

In the following weeks we gradually grew closer, from a casual cafe chat to weekly and then daily meme exchanges. After 3 weeks, we finally had our first date partying together with his friends, and first kiss. A week after: first overnight stay. NYE, he brought me to dinner with his parents, and partying with his friends, and he sent pics with me to a dozen of his friends and biz connections. All was great.

After that we were apart for a month because I visited my parents in another city. But we texted daily, flirting and all. He flew there (city I was in) for a biz thing, and we partied with more friends of his. Then a week after that, I flew back to the city we both are based in, mostly to be near him (because I can afford to work from anywhere). When I communicated this move and the reason, he was happy. 

After I landed, we were closer than ever before. Seeing each other every day for 3 days, in many contexts (airport pickup, work together at home, chilling at friend's). Not all my asking. 

And then, we stopped seeing each other. It started with 3 days without texts from him, and when I asked, he cited ""busy"". Then more days without any other communications from him except his occasional complaints about work. I tried to make the chat box alive for a week with memes or a simple ""are things alright"", but finally couldn't take it anymore and asked for a meal together. He didn't read my texts.

Another week, I asked him to be straightforward and tell me if he's no longer interested, because we might bump into each other so ghosting would cause awkwardness. He still said ""hectic weeks"". So I sent over a long text saying: I wish him lucks, but I am not happy with the 0 comms, and in the future when he has capacity and interest again, ping me. He hasn't read that text.

Weeks later I see pics of him flying to another city, or hanging out with friends, etc. And I feel like a fool for being ghosted.

Now, I trust that he was busy for real (his sister, when bumped into me, also said so). And maybe he's still busy. However, I am confused by this level of... disrespect? Is there any other logical/cultural ways to explain such behaviours?

tl;dr: we were seeing each other, I felt our bond was growing, he brought me to friends', parents', and suddenly he ghosted me. Any explanation?

7121,"If a man is interested, he'll show you, right?","Okay, so I just have to get this gnawing feeling off of my chest. I (f30) have been with my boyfriend (m30) for 12 years, we are high-school sweethearts, we're have survived 2½ years in a long distance relationshop together, we have survived 4 years when he had a very deep, emotionally and psychology damaging depression. 
We have been through alot together. 

Now, to what's bothering me. 
I don't think he actually loves me anymore, he prefers sleeping on the couch rather than in our bed with me - he tells me it's because he can watch TV until he ""collapse"" and sleep. We have a TV in our bedroom, and I have told him he can use it, but ""he does not want to wake me"".
It's been 5 months since we have had sex, he tells me that he's exhausted from his work. We have absolutely no secrets between us, the question of ""is he cheating"" has been on my mind, but I ruled it out very quickly. 
Maybe his depression is coming back? There's a lot of the behaviour that's similar, but then again.. not at all as bad? He has always smokes weed, but recently started to drink a little after work too. 
He does not really want to do anything together other than watch me game, and that's fun, but not nearly enough, I want to go places together like we used to, I want to hang out with my friend with him included (he haver never wanted to hangout with them) I always go alone and feel like the single friend. 

I am so confused. I don't want to leave him. 
We have been together for so long, and I trust him completely, but at this point, I feel so alone, so often that it might as well be the same thing as being single. 

But then again, if he wanted me, like really wanted me. Would a simple thing like sleep together in the same bed be the most natural thing in the world? Can a dry spell take this long? I still want him all the time. Is he just ""used"" to me being here? 

Sorry if there's any misspellings; English is not my first language. 

UPDATE:
Since I posted this, I have tried to start a conversation with him about it, but he only responded with, ""I can't handle talking about this right now."" 
I say it's okay, I don't wish to push him into talking about his feelings, but it hurts me he can't, and it also leave me not being able to talk about my own feelings and how I feel he's distancing himself from me, pushing me away.

7123,Less contact from SO since we made it official,"TL;dr: New SO talking to me notably less since we made it official. 

Me (27) and my SO (24) just agreed to start dating last week. We’re long distance. We met in September and have spoken every day since then intense long conversations and I just came back from visiting him, which went extremely well and he said that he loves me and introduced me to his whole family. He’s put a huge amount of thought and energy into this from the start and has been generally great. But since we agreed to make it official last week I’ve heard much less from him. We still speak every day but much more infrequently, he has less to say and conversation feels more bland. He rescheduled a date night thing three times. He’s ignoring some of my messages. I just feel like the whole tone has changed and there’s suddenly much more distance between us or will from his side to be in touch or close. 

I know this is extremely lame to post about this but I can’t help that it’s causing me a ridiculous amount of anxiety and stress, having been feeling insanely happy and relaxed about the whole thing before, I don’t understand the sudden change of tune and I feel too negative within myself to ask, as it’s such early days to cause an issue and it will almost certainly come off in a way that will make him feel pressured which I don’t want, and he’s probably just busy.

My worries are putting a label on it (which was something he asked to do incidentally) has stressed him or made him realise he’s not as into this as he thought, or now the ‘chase’ is over he doesn’t care as much… why pursue me and push for this so much if when it happens doesn’t want to spend much time with me. It’s like he’s suddenly decided to play it really cool at the weirdest moment. I’m just feeling super negative about it I recognise that it’s the most minor issue ever and with time / a simple conversation it will likely be resolved.

7132,New Possible Partner with Depression,"Hi everyone! I broke up with an emotional and verbal abusive partnership last May and am starting to date again.

Guy I was seeing seemed very sweet and thoughtful and into me, but all of the sudden the energy changed and he stopped communicating with me as much or enthusiastically. I asked if I did something wrong or if everything was alright, and after 4/5 days of things being off, he finally admitted that he’s on a new medication for depression that is really messing with him. At that point I felt uncomfortable with us keeping our plans for the next day because he was clearly not feeling his best, and I thought it would be uncomfortable for us both. 

I feel bad, but this situation has made me question if I want to continue seeing him. Mental health is nothing to be ashamed of, but at 37 I would hope a partner would be a bit more communicative about their struggles and have a better handle on things. Not to discount the actual medical nature of depression in any way, but it sort of triggered me because his behavior was so different and my ex often had me on a roller coaster of highs and lows, and I was constantly monitoring his mood changes to better navigate the relationship.

At 33 I am unsure if I am able/willing to enter into a partnership with someone who may struggle seriously with depression, because I feel I need consistency and dependability.

Does this make me a bad person? Can anyone relate?

I have only been seeing him for a month or so, so this sudden surprising behavior just caught me off guard and sort of changed my outlook. I understand I myself have so many flaws and that any partner I have will also have their own, but I am just conflicted.

Last year, I almost left; booked movers & had a lawyer working on our separation agreement to remove my name from the title on our house. After he found this out, we went through therapy and I have seen a tremendous improvement in his behaviour and can say that he hasn't regressed in over a year now. HOWEVER, I find myself lacking empathy or sympathy towards him when something in his life goes wrong like losing a job, or when he feels ill. I get annoyed when he wants me to care for him when he feels sick or anxious. I still feel like I want to leave him & I feel guilty about that because of the massive changes he's implemented. I don't know if this is the place to post this but, I don't understand why I feel like this towards him & I want to know if someone else has experienced this. It's driving me nuts, not knowing if what I feel is logical or normal. Is it fair that I still feel resentment towards him? I've tried to figure it out on my own but I can't pinpoint it. I've never felt like this.

7136,Partner prevented sleep,"I left my ex in february and lately a lot of situations/feelings have been surfacing. I was just thinking about how he would not let me rest. Situations would look like this: we both get home from work, i cook, we eat. I say good night (he would stay up and come to bed very late, think 3am and wake me by being loud coming in) and he starts a fight. He would just start tearing into me over minor things. Sometimes i didn‘t do the laundry or maybe i was polite to a stranger or maybe i didn‘t want sex. He would go on and on just hailing terrible insults, hitting next to me (not hitting me, he was very proud of that and often mentioned that i should be grateful to him for not laying handy on me) throwing stuff and so on. When he was done i was usually trying not to cry because crying made him angry (he said that me crying is like me accusing him of stuff, not specifying what exactly he meant) and would just try to sleep. He hated that and would come to the bedroom to wake me up shouting that i don‘t care about him or the relationship because i can sleep at a time like this. Cue another hour or so of yelling and me apologizing over and over for the aforementioned things often the only way to stop this was to give in and let him do what he wanted and just hope for it to be over quickly. The next day he would question me if i had told anyone.

7137,How would you respond if your partner said they needed alone time for a couple hours?,"Today at work, I (34F) texted my partner (45M) that I needed to go to my place to take a nap with my elderly cat, because I was feeling extremely empty and I’m about to start my period. He then flies off the handles saying it “feels off” and “strange” that I need alone time. I apologize to my boss, leave 3 hours early, cry and try to ward off an anxiety attack, and take a nap with my gal. I told bf I would see him and his kids at 430 at his house. He just stopped by my place and walked in and saw the cat laying by the window and said, “oh you’re having snuggle time huh?” I started crying and telling me he doesn’t respect my boundaries. He said, “I wanted to see how my girl was.” NO HE WASNT!  He was invading my safe space to upset me. He fought with me for an hour and half via text before I left work because I said I needed time alone. He didn’t once tell me to feel better, he instantly made it all about HIM.  He said, “you’re in a family now. You don’t get alone time.” 

Why am l not allowed to have alone time?!

Not sure how him having 2 children turned into me sacrificing my every waking second to accommodate him and his insecurities. 


I honestly could write a book with everything he has said and done to me (my actions, too. I have done things I’m not proud of because of him while I’m in emotional distress by what he puts me through.) My perspective isn’t off like he tries to convince me it is. If he was the sweet and loving man he pretends to be, I would have gotten texts like, “I’m so sorry you’re having a difficult day. Go rest and snuggle with your cat. I’ll have a bath ready for you when I see you” or something! But nope, guilted, shamed, manipulated, and boundaries disrespected AGAIN.

7146,He is grateful for me and i want to be a better partner (update),"For context. Yesterday or earlier i went to this subreddit(?) To read/ask how i could be a better partner to my boyfriend because I'm not expressive and i felt bad and felt like i didn't deserve him and i also felt like i was emotionally abusing him. But people here says otherwise and told me to leave him. I've been wanting break up for quite sometime now but i really don't want to just leave him without saying goodbye so i did call him said i wanted to break up then immediately blocked him. The pictures included showed the last messages he sent me. I may have him get angry cause i kept blocking all his new numbers that kept calling me. I did block this but i wasn't able to block him on time and this is what i saw. 

He did came over but he really wasn't violent and i felt bad cause he was crying so hard. He kept apologizing and he said he wanted us to start again that he'll be better. He won't hit me again and that he wouldn't push me to move in with him. And i feel like maybe i was overreacting and that I'm the abuser. He was so distraught and broken I don't know anymore I'm sorry.

7148,Am I the bad partner?,"Sometimes I wonder if he has a point that I started the whole downfall of our relationship by not being a good partner

I don’t give him enough attention, and he always wants more… if I am doing work and if he wants help with something (non-urgent) I feel like I have to drop everything. If I was in the middle of doing something and he start a conversation/starts asking questions about something that is not a super serious topic and I resume work during the gaps in the conversation it’s “well, I can see you’re obviously busy” and then silent treatment for hours.

I get into bed and don’t cuddle up to him right away because I am double checking my work schedule or I want to read a book? He gets upset. If he cares that much I always wonder why he doesn’t just come up to me to find a position that allows me to continue what I am doing?

If I don’t go up to him and kiss him as soon as I walk in the door there’s always some Passive aggressive comment (I always say hello but he needs me to physically kiss him). But I also wonder why don’t you put your video games down and come up and greet ME if it’s so important to you?? Am I just not being loving enough? Am I a bad partner?

Sometimes he will just out of the blue say things like “something is off, why are you being so cold” when I feel like I am acting completely normal. Once he said this when I drove to the airport to pick him up in the middle of the night and waited outside of the car and ran up to hug him.

7149,What do you do if partner threatens/hints at suicide or child abandonment?,"I posted a couple days ago about my bf who I have a 3yo son with. 

I’ve been trying to break it off because in the past he was physically abusive and a couple weeks ago, he threatened to punch me in the face in front of our son. Which my son then told my parents. I know how bad that is for a child to hear and I want to leave.

Since then, he’s been trying to convince me to stay. He’s hinted about “leaving forever” either by suicide or just leaving and getting out of our life. My heart breaks for my son in either of those scenarios. I also would never forgive myself if he died. Like ever. I would be completely devastated and think it was my fault. I don’t want him dead or gone forever, I just want to not be in a relationship with him, but I still want my son to have his dad. 

Last night, he came back because he wanted to talk, then left on foot which I didn’t realize and went to a foot bridge over a freeway near our home. Then he called me and we were arguing and he was hinting at suicide but didn’t say those exact words. Eventually, I realized where he was and said I would have to call 911 if he didn’t come back. He did come back and leave in his car, but I did like practically beg him to come inside because he scared me.

I woke up this morning feeling emotionally drained and so depressed. I feel manipulated and confused and sad. I genuinely don’t know what to do. 

I know that if I stayed that would only be because of what he’s threatening. I do love and care about him but it’s not fair that I have to stay because he’s threatening this. I wish it was different, I wish he treated me better so I could stay. I wish the good times were all the time and he was respectful. His bad times are so disrespectful and angry, I know I deserve peace.

7150,Does anyone else’s ex or partner pretend they are the victim?,"My ex cheated on me, lied to me, stole from me, destroyed my property, manipulated me, etc. When I would get upset about something he had done that hurt me and I would confront him with those feelings he would self-harm in front of me. He got drunk and disappeared with my dog one night. Things never changed. And now that we’re broken up, he tells anyone who will listen that I was horrible to him. And he does it in a way that he takes some of the blame, but not all. Like for example, “I have my flaws but at least I’ll admit it.”

What kind of tactic is this? He will even do it to my face. He asks me why I am moving on and acts confused as to why we broke up. When we first broke up we remained close for awhile. He was persistent that he wanted to get back together, so I had a very honest conversation with him and told I am moving on and plan on dating other people. 

He’s told me this is the same as when he cheated on me. He has guilted me ever since I was honest. I didn’t tell him to hurt him, I just didn’t want to lead him on. He’s told everyone who will listen that I cheated on him.

7153,Partner does not seem to understand the gravity of the situation,"Throwaway account because I can't risk anyone I know seeing this. My husband either does not understand how serious his actions are or is unwilling to face the emotions that accompany facing it. A few months ago I ended up in the emergency room with various injuries inflicted by my partner. Among the injuries was a ruptured eardrum that has yet to fully heal, a concussion, and a broken nose. I have ongoing issues from the injuries I sustained, and it has taken a toll on my daily life and emotional wellbeing. We do not have children, but I do live states away from other family members and am currently enrolled in school. I am very close to graduation, but feel very trapped in my situation for the time being. That being said, I feel like my partner simply does not understand the gravity of his behavior. For a month after this happened he was out of the house and I truly believed things may be different (I know, I know). I now see that this was not the case. While he has been going to therapy, is on medication, and has taken steps to improve himself, I feel that his unwillingness to acknowledge what a traumatizing situation this was for me is unacceptable. He has slowly gone back to subtely blaming me for his inability to emotionally handle certain situations that have nothing to do with me, saying things like ""well, if you had done this or that I wouldn't have been put in a situation where I got so angry."" He seems to feel like his recovery relies on me being observant of my own actions and ""helping him"" do better. I feel in my gut that this is unfair and absurd, and I know I shouldn't need to seek validation for it, but I am looking for similar experiences and validation nonetheless. He does not want to be reminded of the situation, because he says he is working on himself and has made progress, and the reminders bring him back to a place of depression and emotional unrest. I am almost certain that this is unfair, but the place I am currently at is blurring reality a bit for me.

7154,I feel worse after leaving my abusive partner,"I thought I would feel much happier and liberated after I left this abusive relationship, but now it seems my mental health has gotten worse. It’s hard to describe it, but throughout my teenage years of isolation in my bedroom, and my head surrounded by depression that’s caused from my social anxiety, I wish I had someone there to talk to and comfort me. I’ve tried chatting anonymously with people online who seem to genuinely understand me, but it doesn’t feel the same as talking about it in person, because I could also express my thoughts while crying on someone’s shoulder rather than just communicating through plain text. 

I met this guy at a point in my life when I’m desperate to have someone who understands me like that, and he gave me exactly what I needed for the first year of being with him. Not only that, but he loved me more than even my own neglectful parents, and saw something special in me that no one else did and deeply cherished it. He played with my heart very well as you can imagine, and I was head over heels for him when he made me feel like I was genuinely loved and cared for. 

I had a strong dependency on him afterwards, because I thought that there was no other man who could ever treat me better than him, and I was willing to make this relationship work despite his abusive nature. I was dependent on him for helping me to cope with my mental health, to accept and become content with who I am that’s unchangeable, and to guide me into a positive direction in my life, while having him the one to strongly lead this relationship. Then whenever he became mad towards me and got physical, I blamed myself for not trying hard enough to please him or to make him happier. It’s like he programmed me into becoming this dependent, as I now feel so lost and alone without him. And I never once felt independent as a teenager, but now it feels like that’ll be harder for me to become. That guy DESTROYED me.

Now I can’t do anything on my own without freaking out if this is the right decision to make, and I could only feel anything positive if it came from someone or something else. It’s really affecting my everyday life. I feel like a vulnerable little puppy that was abandoned in the middle of an overgrown forest. I feel like I’ve lost every single thing that was good in my life once my ex is gone, even if I know there was nothing good that I had with him!

7159,"Emotionally abusive partner accusing me of ""withholding affection""","And they are either talking about before I confronted him about his emotional abuse, which was when I would ""shut down"" after his meltdowns at me (because he'd use crazy making, darvo, gaslight me, bring up things I've done in the past, and otherwise twist anything I say and use it against me). It's like I was empty, I could no longer try to us logic or remain rational - I would start crying in frustration. There was nothing left to give. 

OR - after confronting them on their emotional abuse. Which is where I basically gave them a quasi ultimatum for divorce. We are sleeping in different rooms, there is no affection because I have felt like he's more a roommate or a child anyways vs my partner. He basically begged me to go to marriage counseling before considering divorce and I said yes. 

Now among other things, they're trying to negate them being an emotionally abusive person by saying I've also been that way to them. One of the things they bring up is me withholding affection...but if I'm contemplating divorce because they've literally been abusive to me, why would I think about being affectionate with them?! Please make it make sense!

Let me end by saying, affection wasn't so much lacking in my opinion before I came to this realization I've been emotionally abused. I liked making out a lot/foreplay, he didn't. He apparently liked just a lot of sex/had a higher sex drive, I didn't. But he didn't initiate sex hardly at all. When I did were usually the times when he said no. When he did I don't think there were many times I said no at all. He wasn't much into foreplay. And I was usually the one that had to do a lot of the ""work"" if you know what I mean lol. But then he would also complain we weren't having sex often at all and would ask if there were any problems/would say he feels unattractive because of it. When I'd point out he rarely initiated it, he'd basically deflect the point like it did not matter (implying it was all my fault). And we discussed that before and tried to make it a point to do that more often, because that is what married couples do, right? So anyways sex might have been a thing but it was unequal sex drives.

7162,My partner and his anger issues regarding sleeping,"Hey everyone, 

i am currently looking for a reality check regarding my boyfriend and me. We've been together for 5 years now and lived together for 4. This year a really big issue has emerged and i feel so overwhelmed by it that i cant seem to think straight. 

My boyfriend works some weird shifts and also enjoys staying up for long hours after work to relax. This means that we usually sleep at very different times, which i am ok with, but he isn't. He usually wants me to stay up until like 4 am with him, even when i have to wake up at 8. No matter how often i explain to him that i need my sleep, he does not seem to understand. He gets extremely pissed off, passive aggressive, and even insulting (""What do you even need to sleep so long for? You don't even do anything important in your life""). This put  me under a lot of stress and i got so sleep deprived this summer that i developed some health issues. 

 A couple of weeks ago, he tried to change his sleep schedule by sleeping for a couple of hours in the evening, spend time with me, and then is awake the rest of the night. He also wants me to wake him. He does not tell me WHEN he wants me to wake him, and gets pissed off when i did not guess correctly (""You let me sleep for 3 hours? Now the whole evening is ruined because its so late!"" vs. ""You let me sleep for two hours? Thats not nearly enough! Why are you incapable of thinking?""). He gets extremely pissed off when i point this out and just continues to tell me to ""just use my brain once in my life and stop acting like a dumb b\*\*\*\*"". I feel so helpless and discouraged. 

The weird thing is that sometimes our schedules line up, so we both sleep enough. On this days our relationship is amazing! We chat and talk the whole day and have a great time together. Its just fucking with my head so much when he insults me again because of the sleep issue in the evening. Like, i get panic attacks when he enters the bedroom because i am so afraid of being called names. This whole situation is just so fucked up. And he doesn't acknowledge it. He just acts as if his anger episodes did not happen and refuses to talk with me about it later.

  This behavior is not normal, right? What do i do now? I am so afraid of being alone, but i also cannot feel comfortably in my own home because of this nearly daily issue. But it only started this year, so this could be fixed?

7170,What Abusers Say About Their Past Partners Is a Warning Sign,"I was thinking over everything my abusive ex said about his past two girlfriends. If I would have read between the lines back then, I would have seen how he was abusing them too. Here are some things he said about them that didn’t add up. 
1. He said that both of them vindictively cheated on him and how he had scarring trust issues because of it. But it turns out, he never actually had evidence that either of them had cheated. Sure enough in my relationship with him, he irrationally accused me of cheating at every turn. 
2. He told me he dumped GF#1 because she “gave up on the relationship”. I think she got so broken down by the abuse that she stopped being herself because of it. The same thing happened to me and I was also accused of giving up on the relationship. 
3. He blamed getting a DUI on GF#2 and said it was her fault he was drunk driving. Apparently she did not answer her phone when he called, so he said she was talking to other guys. (He offered no other explanation besides that.) So he was speeding off to her apartment to go tell her off when he was pulled over. She wasn’t talking to other guys! Whenever I didn’t answer my phone immediately he said I was talking to other guys too. 
4. He acted like fights with me were not normal arguments since I didn’t scream in his face, throw punches, and call the police. He seemed so proud of his ability to bring out reactive abuse in his victims and then call them psycho.

7171,Abusive Ex has new partner,"Hi All. 

(TL;DR - very abusive ex has moved on within a year with a new girlfriend. Do I try and warn her?

Background. I am a year out of an abusive relationship which was sexually, physically and emotionally abusive.  There is police involvement to which i am awaiting an outcome. I was diagnosed with CPTSD and depression. I have come so far on my healing journey, that is up until last night. Last night i was out for coffee with a platonic friend and my abuser / ex walked past with a new partner looking very happy. He did not see me.  

It took all of my strength not to run over to them. I wanted to walk up to the girl he was holding hands with and tell her to run fast and hard away from him. or just drop a note about 'claires law' in front of her. 

I am completely over this man. The abusive i suffered at his hands was horrific, and I am still picking up the pieces of my life.  Seeing him for the first time since I left a year ago feels like i am back to being that victim. He left me in such a state that my friends or family did not really know who i was anymore.  How do i ground my self knowing he is out-there living a normal life and has 'moved on' form me. I cannot even entertain looking at another romantic relationship right now. The scars are just too raw. 

secondly, do I try and find this girl? Do i warn her? i know she is not my responsibility but i wish someone had warned me. I do not how i would feel if she ended up like me. 

Any guidance from any one who has experienced similar would be gratefully appreciated.

7173,Are abusive partners (or ex partners) ever remorseful?,"Just left my abusive ex [26m] about a month ago. The last incident that made me leave was the night before Mother’s Day (my first Mother’s Day) he came home drunk and started screaming and throwing furniture. I called the cops and they made him leave. He then went to the bar and harassed me through text all night. The next day he came home and instead of apologizing he demanded to look through my phone (for what reason I have no idea?) we fought over my phone and he ended up breaking it. He left again, harassed me over text again saying he was going to hangout with another girl and that “I lost him”. I had enough. I was done. While he was away from the house I broke our lease (it was only in my name), I hired a moving coming to take all our stuff and donate it, and I left the state with our son. 

We haven’t said a word to each other since. 

Do people like this ever feel remorse? This was a nightmare for me. I cried all day on my first Mother’s Day, dealt with cops, child services. Etc. his family thinks I’m a monster for leaving the way I did. They enable and justify his abuse.

How’s that normal? I feel like there’s sm negativity. He scruffed her hard and slapped her neck and it made me mad and he blamed me and said next time I should make sure she isn’t in the kitchen. Before that, he let my dog run out the door because I tried to end it with him so you understand how I may feel a type of way that he’s so negative.

So he shows up unannounced (he has key, it's his place and I'm trying to find other housing) and says all kind of lovey things, I guess to reel me in again?   


Been a week since I saw him now, none of us has made attempts at contact. I don't know what it is that keeps me so so stuck in this, obsessing, it's like some incongruency where he tells me how much he loves me but then he has treated me awfully since and in my mind it doesn't make sense. It keeps me thinking over the same things over and over. I think his mind split somehow when he hurt me, he despises men who are violent toward women and he became one.  He has an image of himself like this perfect person and when he doesn't live up to it something disconnects. He tells me he has to move on, but still comments that he's seen me streaming on Twitch and wishes he was like me, who can just move on and be happy, I guess so I tell him how I've not and still here on the shelf?  


I've lost almost 10 kgs of weight and feel awful. I need some plan of what to say if he turns up again. I love him so much I feel stupid when I see him, just want a hug. Can violence be a one-time thing? The way he's treated me after is worse though, I never thought he'd be like that to me.

Thankful for any advice of how to stop the endless rumination and how to respond if he shows up.",cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
7189,Can extremely abusive men ever treat their partners well?,"
Being in a very traumatizing relationship with my abusive boyfriend for years made me wonder if men like him can actually truly love their partner and treat them well long-term. I’ve always hoped that he would change someday or that I could change him for the better but that never happened. 

To give you a better picture, this is how I would describe him:

He is very selfish, has a superficial charm in public, lies all the time, is never concerned about the pain he caused me or others, has no empathy whatsoever, can get angry VERY FAST (even over very small & unimportant things), is obsessed with power, control and dominance and is a thrill-seeker. He never accepts responsibility for his own actions and he loves to degrade, humiliate and hurt other people (especially women) & even proudly admitted that to me. Unfortunately, i was sexually abused by him many times and he emotionally abused me throughout the whole relationship. I think a major problem is that he gets a thrill out of inflicting pain on other people, especially on me. By making me suffer, he elevates himself and the more grandiose he becomes.  

I suggested in a kind way that he could seek professional help for his issues but he said he knows he’s got mental health issues but that he doesn’t need any help. 
Sometimes I’m spiraling and still wondering if the relationship with him failed so badly because I was not good enough for him and/or did something wrong. 
Do you think a man like him can ever treat a partner well long term? Do you think a man like him can suddenly change just because he falls in love with somebody?",cannot be inferred,no,yes,plausibly,yes,,yes,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

I stupidly got back together with him but now we had an argument and he left and said he wants us to separate to which I agreed.

We argued about sharing finances. I let him know that I wasn’t ok with him not contributing to our expenses. He has been jobless for 6 years and I am the primary breadwinner. As you know, discussing these things don’t go well with narcissists, so we started arguing. He told me I belittled him because he doesn’t have money and all the guilt tripping.  Somehow we also got into a discussion on his abuse and shocker he blamed our son for being strangked and he also said “I did not strangle him too hard”. He was angry that I still bring up this as he said it’s in the past. He also told our son it’s his fault that we are fighting.

I am actually taking time out of finishing my thesis because it's bothering me a lot - not just the residual physical pain but the worries of what could happen next. Last night he got to my house after asking to come over (he currently lives with his parents) and of course I said yes - I'm always so excited to see him! When he arrives he has to wait before I let him through the gate to reach my door bc our buzzer doesn't work but I got there before he did and figured it would be funny to scare him a bit and pop out from behind the gate. I know what you're already thinking - he just hit me in self-defense from being spooked right? Wrong. I still had to let him in from behind the gate and after I shut it from behind him he turned around and hit me so effing hard in the arm that I actually screamed. He's a strong boy and I'd like to say that maybe he just didn't realize how hard he was gonna hit me but there was a wind-up and he blocked me so I couldn't move. This is the first time that he has gotten physically violent at me. Prior he has lost his temper and had thrown things, hit things, and smashed things but never did anything to me and told me he would never touch me. I made sure and asked him to reassure me that he never would. Now he's saying it will never happen again. I've been a victim of physical violence from an ex and my partner knew that as well. He's now saying he doesn't know what more he could do aside from telling me he's sorry and how much he loves me to make up for the trust he lost. What do I do? I love him a lot and I feel like maybe I'd be blowing things out of proportion if I broke up with him just because he hit me once.

7216,ex partner convinced me im boring and ive developed huge anxiety about it,"Hi everyone,
I (36F)got out if my abusive relationship over 2 years ago. It was a giant mess but i managed to get far away from my ex partner (49M). 

Before the relationship, though like everyone i had some self esteem issues, i was very outgoing and bubbly. I lived in a lot of different countries due to work, my work is really interesting, and i have always been interested in many things, especially music, history and politics. I was an artist many years ago and i suppose the picture im painting is of a person who was always living life to the full. Thats how i felt anyway!

My partner, while being physically abusive, also really spent a lot of time convincing me i was boring. I know the reason he did this was to control me, stop me socialising. Now, i always retorted ""nope, thats not true, youre an alco, you're boring"", and so on.

When i first broke up with him i was anxious about EVERYTHING. I was afraid to go for walks by myself. 2 years and ive come on leaps and bounds, and im working with a great therapist doing emdr therapy. However, ive developed huge anxiety over this idea that im not interesting, that i dont have develpped hobbies, that i dont know how to talk to people (i was always known as a person who never stopped talking!), that ive nothing to add to a conversation. I want to start dating again, but im terrified ill be boring or wont be fun enough- a date is essentially talking to people after all! I know that these are self esteem issues that take time to work out, but a little voice inside is terrified that all the fun in me has been destroyed. I moved country so i dont have many friends around, which doesnt help this idea, and because of covid i couldnt go out and meet people for 1.5 years, so the idea then festered. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? I keep asking my therapist if im broken forever and she just shakes her said and says no but its hard to believe. Im meant to have a date on friday and im terrified i wont be fun, and then if it goes well and he wants to see me again if he doesnt realise friday im a bore he realise next time, oh god my stupid brain.

7217,TW? Struck in the face by partner,"Throwaway account + writing on mobile.
Initially posted on r/relationships

Me and my boyfriend have been in a relationship just shy of 4 years, during this time I have never experienced any sort of violence. And the relationship have been loving and nice.

However earlier today as he was eating a dessert treat of those types that is creamy with a coat of chocolate. I nudged his arm (intentionally)with the treat twice so that he got cream on his face for fun as a goofy/playful thing. However after the last time of getting cream in his face he slapped me across the face with enough force for it to sting and turn red. (This was done at a friend of his with the friend in the room). I think I yelped and got tears in my eyes immediately after and shortly thereafter left the room and went to the guestroom where we had been staying.

It’s not so much the pain from being struck, but the fact that the person I love and trust most in the whole world would inflict pain on me.

Shortly after I left, he came after me and apologised profoundly and first said he didn’t intend to slap my face but grab my shoulder (both were sitting down) and later changed it to not intending to do it as forcefully as he had. And stressed how he doesn’t want to hurt me intentionally.

A naive part of me wants to believe him, but right now my trust for him is broken and I am struggling to even look at him. However I told him  I might be willing to try(!) and put it behind me if he goes to therapy which he has agreed to. But I don’t know what to think or feel right now. However I think it’s clear to him that if anything like that happens again we are done. But my mind is chaotic and I feel hollow but at the same time it feels like I might burst into tears..

tl;dr been together ~4 years he struck me, I don’t know what to feel or think and he is remorseful.

7229,"Pregnant, abusive partner.","I don't know where to begin or if I'm doing the right thing posting at all but I need outside perspective & I'm too afraid to tell anyone I know. 

I've been with my boyfriend for nearly 5 months. I wasn't looking to date really but he caught me by surprise...he seemed so different than what I was used to. Extremely caring and sweet, charming, almost too attentive. Patient at first.

Fast forward a little and we decide on something of a D/s relationship. I'm happy with it. The only time things get physical or rough is in the bedroom. 

But more and more he shows an explosive temper- followed at first by extreme apologies. A true Jekyl and Hyde. No I'm between for him...one second I make him happy and the next I'm a ""stupid c*** who messes everything up"". When I try to discuss or resolve anything it turns into him getting angry and holding me down  putting a hand over my mouth until I agree to be quiet. 

He claims he cant help himself. He just loves me so much and I just set his temper off. Sometimes he'll literally turn the situation around and say I'm the abusive one, with a challenging little smile on his face. 

It has gotten worse since I found out I was pregnant last month. The past week and a half he has ""lost his temper"" and physically attacked me every day. 

Sometimes its just holding his hand over my mouth so tight I can't breathe for a while, almost always with whipping me around by my hair and choking me. 

A few times he's had me trapped beneath him and just went crazy punching all over...my legs and hips and arms...my face. He made a comment about the bruises and seemed so ashamed but I don't know what to think. 

He has always insisted it's a thing of passion....of uncontrollable anger. But today he said again that I needed to obey and listen to him, to stop angering him, as he was choking me...I was so scared and I was fighting instinctually and he told me to ""just stop refusing me, go limp NOW or it will be bad for you."" 

I was so afraid I couldn't really process what he was saying I just kept thrashing and crying ""no, no, just stop."" And he mocked me for saying no...told me I was too arrogant and disobedient and ""Maybe I'll have to beat it out of you"".

7232,Should I reach out to new partner if it might affect my safety? Feeling very silenced,"I was in a very physically abusive relationship with someone for 2 years in 2015-2017. The last time we were in contact was 2019 when he attacked me, pinned me down and was threatening to kill me. He left my city in early 2021 to move to the west coast.

Now, I have been following his every move on social media because I was so scared of him to move back and I found out he just moved back to my city. He has not reached out to me but yet I feel so scared. I think part of the reason he hasn't reached out is because he's with a new woman. Our resemblance is uncanny. She's the same age I was when we first started dating (very young), shes the same ethnicity as me, and she just moved to this country very recently. I know he is probably preying on her because that was exactly me when we met.

But here is my dilemma. I'm terrified of him. I don't want him anywhere near me and as far away as possible. I know that if I reached out to her and he found out about it, he would come find me because he would be so upset that I'm ""ruining his life."" He attacked me before when he found out that I was talking about the abuse to my friends. But I feel some sort of moral obligation to tell her. I'm scared of him but angry that he has silenced me so much that I'm too scared to even tell anyone how dangerous he is. What should I do?

Wanted to add: I already had a restraining order against him for 3 years. He broke it so many times and the police did nothing. And secondly, the reason I am extra worried for her is that he has a history of physically abusing now 3 different women.

TLDR: Abuser has moved back to my city. Fortunately he has not tried contacting me because he is with a new woman. I am worried for her and want to reach out but also worried that'll make him attack me again. I feel silenced but worried for my safety.

7234,What now? I (25 F) am weighing my options to deal with my partner (28 M),"Hello all,

I made a post in /relationships and was referred here after my post. The short of the story is my partner put his hands around my neck (didn't squeeze) and yanked my hair after an argument. He has done similar things in the past, such as raising a fist to me to intimidate. He's also been violent with others and has admitted to trying to actively murder someone who was abusive in the past.

Needless to say, this terrifies me and this feels like an escalation and I am not sure I can continue with this. Initially he was very unapologetic and told me I should feel embarrassed for making him do that. I've left to stay with my parents for awhile a couple hours away, and now he's overapologizing and has suddenly decided to go to therapy. Though he suddenly is denying any of this happened. He said he never put his hand on me, he just put it NEAR my neck, and he's saying that he never pulled my hair. He apparently just disassociated, his hand was numb and it just accidentally got caught in my hair. It seems like gaslighting to me. 

I will have to return to my home at some point (we live together and we're in a lease for another year and both our names are on the lease.) I do work from home so it's a possibility I could go back and get my stuff and live with my parents, though I'd probably still be responsible for the lease. Or I could go back and try to live with him for the remainder. I'm not sure how safe this is, and I'm worried I might fall right back into the role of being a girlfriend and potentially get physically harmed.

7241,I’m angry because being female means I can’t drive and I’m stuck with an abusive partner,"I came from a country where women are statistically less likely to have driving skills and most have no experience or license. My parents were very conservative and enforced these social rules, teaching my brothers to drive but telling me and my sisters that we shouldn’t learn to drive because we should find a man worthy of us who will provide everything and drive us wherever we need to go.

Now I’m in the US and I met this man who said he would teach me to drive and support me through college and honestly seemed like a dream; my parents never supported my independence but he did. I moved in with him and found out it was all a lie and he only wanted me because I was raised to be more submissive than US women and not being able to drive gave him more control. 

He now controls my whole life and he uses the fact that I can’t drive a lot. He also uses rape and physical attacks as punishment. 

I can’t leave because I can’t drive anywhere and I will lose everything like my job and housing and I can’t drive anywhere to get help.

I felt that he wasn't being reasonable with regards to the situation (he was trying to complete something that just wasn't working out, and he was spending hours on it) plus he was expecting me to help him endlessly and I was getting very frustrated.

&#x200B;

A verbal argument erupted and it just didn't go well. I don't even recall exactly what was being said, but he was shouting at me and I was telling him that the project was never going to work out (I was being realistic but not very supportive). I don't know what was said that made him snap, but he came over and grabbed my arm, hard. He's grabbed me before and we agreed he would never put his hands on me again, so I pushed him back off me.

7266,Sudden interest in seeing children after default entry filed,"So throughout this pandemic, I’ve had my 2 children in my care. Nex has not communicated with the children regularly and hasn’t really asked to see them in person. 

Recently, I filed the default judgment because he never replied to the custody petition. It has been submitted for judicial review. So he found out about this, and is now sort of aggressively messaging me asking to see the kids or begging me to do mediation with him. I’m wondering why he hasn’t thought to just file the response. I was able to file my default paperwork at the court recently but he explains COVID is the reason for being unable to do anything on his end about it, even though he defaulted before the courts closed back in March. Also wondering why didn’t he ask for mediation months ago? 

For a little background, he has been living with the other woman since day 1 of our breakup (it’s been 8 months) and their first kid will be born in a couple of months. In this time frame, he has continued to use drugs, was detained in a psych ward, and arrested for DV. So I’m sure he has been preoccupied. But also I feel like the impending birth of their child might have something to do with the hoovering? I say this because his partner also decided to message me saying “How could you keep the kids away from their father and new sibling?”

He doesn’t show any signs of actually caring about the kids besides him TELLING me he wants to see them. Doesn’t pay child support, rarely calls them, and my son recently went to the ER and nex didn’t visit. 

But sometimes I wonder whether he’s actually in a better place mentally and if I’m being unreasonable for not allowing the children to be with him and not giving in to any of his requests. Or maybe his constant asking is meant to make me feel guilty?

","I have been with my partner for a very long time and over the years, he just seems to be prioritising every other person (friends, parents and siblings and even strangers) over me a little more each day. It’s at the point where if I am stranded or in trouble his response is ‘call someone else’ because he’s with friends. We haven’t exchanged more than a couple of words a day or every second day because he’s ’not a talker’ for at least a year, yet he has the time to talk to his friends and family allllllll day and night long. Every time I bring it up, he treats me like it’s in my head and I’m crazy. But I can see what I can can see. When I was assaulted, he didn’t bother coming home for hours because he was hanging out with friends, then treated me like I was a bad person for not checking on a friend for a superficial problem despite that I was injured and had a traumatic brain injury.  When we are out in public settings he speaks a language I don’t know (despite several times me saying that I feel excluded) yet within 10 seconds he ‘forgets’ 

Everyone who knows him thinks I’m overreacting because he couldn’t possibly do that. He’s so nice. He truly is, just not to me.

I found out by going his deleted messages after a night out at the bar. 
I scrolled through a lot of it and would stop, read a section, video it on my phone and then repeat that process until I was fed up. 
I immediately confronted him and have rolling in rage since. 

Part of me wants to read it all. Their messages were long form conversation, paragraphs of normal conversation with the emotional cheating sandwiched in there somewhere. I think it will keep me angry and delay the grief and sadness part. 

So I’m asking you guys. Did you read it all when you found it? Did you just get the basics and move on? Did you have a reason either way to make that choice? 


MINOR UPDATE: After reading a lot of your responses, I did decide to record the deleted messages to have on my own phone. I did read quite a bit, but stopped to have a breakdown when I read they met more than the one time I knew about and how he felt kissing her. 

At this moment, it’s keeping me angry and devastated that he lied to me in the first place and then wasn’t transparent after he was caught. Maybe it will make it easier for me leave, I don’t know.

He threatened to kill me. I told him he wouldn’t do that, and I meant it, but I guess that was somehow more insulting and he was enraged. He tried to kill me via strangulation. He’s in jail now and I’m safe for the time being, hopefully the courts will rule in my favor.

7321,How to refrain from contacting them when you have angry revelations?,"I have them all the time. Today I realized I was so brainwashed that so many things he did would have been major blowups in any other relationship but were so casual in our relationship. He had cheated on me with his ex, not sexual but kissing and cuddling and showering together and sleeping in the same bed for their biweekly sleepover weekends, and refused to set boundaries with her. I didn’t know all that was going on until 9 months in when most of it finally came out (after she blew up because she felt like she was losing him to me). He never took full accountability, he thought it should be ok to do those things with a “friend.” I tried to work with him for so long, I even tried to find a way to keep her in the picture but he refused to set boundaries with her. He would agree to certain boundaries and then take it back the next day, insisting that they needed to have sleepovers or cuddle or whatever and that it’s ok because they’re platonic. I was so convinced that I was crazy and controlling and possessive. 

But the thing I remembered today is that after all of that, when he was telling me there were more boundaries between them and they were just normal friends now, she was texting him asking if he wanted to move in with her. And he said maybe. He was texting her apartment links in front of me so I asked what was going on, and he *so casually* just said “oh yeah she asked if I wanted to move in with her, I meant to ask you about it.” 

I’m so angry looking back because at the time I hardly reacted. It was so typical in our relationship that my response was simply “I wouldn’t be ok with that.” I didn’t realize until now what a betrayal it was for him to have even entertained her offer to move in together. In any relationship I know of that would cause a huge conflict. I am so desperate to tell him I’ve now realized how wrong that was, to have cheated in the first place but then to have been totally boundaryless with her after. I know he’ll never really see it but that’s what keeps me so stuck. I’m so desperate for him to see how wrong it all was. He doesn’t. He just dumped me and said he wanted to try to find someone else. He was on dating apps days later with his bio saying he wants to find a life partner. And I’m sure he’s just jumped right back into his ex’s arms. I’m so mad. I wish he saw.

7329,Anyone else's ex INSIST on remaining friends post-breakup?,"When I left my nex-husband, he said he really wanted to stay friends.  I said that I didn't really think that was appropriate, and he demanded to know ""why"".  No answer I provided him was sufficient, and he kept asking ""why"" until I relented.  After all, I told myself, there was a reason we had gotten married in the first place, so why shouldn't we stay friends?  (I was still very much in the fog and hadn't figured out he was a narc yet).

But I was uncomfortable hanging out with him or attending events he was at.  After about a year (I'm embarrassed it was even that long), I put more and more distance between us and started declining most invitations to do things.  But at one point towards the end of the façade that was our post-divorce ""friendship"", he even invited my partner and I to go camping with him and his girlfriend (this was like 3 years post-divorce!).  Like, how could he not see that maintaining a close friendship with your ex-spouse is just weird and inappropriate??!?!

I assume it's either because he couldn't let go of the supply (he continued to try and financially manipulate me for \~4 years post-divorce...), or he wanted to maintain a certain image publicly.  Certainly he's not a bad guy if his ex wife will still be friends with him, right?

This video really almost made me cry. The man described how he has always felt a bit of an outsider / socially awkward and has low self esteem / doesn't easily open up to people.

This is how I have felt for such a long time, and also what my ex mirrored to me to make me fall for him. It was like watching a copy of the persona he presented to me, but then a genuine version. I felt so sad for the guy and I could relate so much. He seemed kind, shy, a bit introverted and so sweet.

This made me realise how much I thought my ex was to me, but it was all a fake and a lie. He knew exactly how to get to me, I must say, great acting very well done. And now I don't miss him but I was so happy to feel like I finally found that person, and then so sad to have it taken away again and realising it was all on purpose to hook me.

And so angry with him, I mean he must have sensed my loneliness and took advantage of that in the most cruel way. I could never imagine doing that to the man in the video, you see a persons pain then abuse that. It's about time I got angry, I have only felt sadness until now.

How do I know? Because I did the fucking work.

This is what recovery feels like.,"I'm on a short holiday, visiting a beautiful village with my husband. One of my close friends and her family live here. This is also where one of my abusive ex-partners lives... as I met this sorry excuse for man through my lovely friend, many years ago.

Anyway, it was late at night and I wanted to grab a few things at the supermarket, after a long drive to get here. My husband stayed outside the supermarket, catching up on his messages on his phone. I ducked in and grabbed the goods. I was at the checkout and my ex-boyfriend came right up to me and said ""Hello, what are you doing in town?"" 

It was a shock and I didn't even recognize him and first. Even his voice did not sound familiar and to my relief, his voice did not trigger anything in me. The sight of him did nothing to me - it could have been anyone, I did not feel familiar with him. He was like a complete stranger - which he now is, of course. I said 'I'm visiting my friend"" and also ""I haven't been here for ages"" and also mentioned the obvious - that I needed a few supplies. I'm pretty sure I smiled, as I am generally I smiley person. (I couldn't think of much else to say.) I looked back up from my groceries and he had disappeared!! That was weird.

When I got home, I noticed he had sent me a text, which seemed to try to explain why he suddenly ""disappeared"". He wrote ""I guess I'm the last person you want to run into."" I thought that given all the circumstances, he was making the situation way too personal, assuming that there was negative emotion on my side, when there was nothing at all on my side. I noticed that I did not feel anxious or anything. In fact, settling into the accommodation with my husband that night, I didn't think much of it. I slept well.

The next morning (I know this is wrong) I replied to his text, saying that I was only going to be in town for a short break and if I did happen to run into him, I would say hello, and it wasn't any problem for me at all. Straight way he replied back that he would love to have a chat with me!! For God's sake.

Me and this person’s relationship started off very fast, as I know it’s common for abusive partners to lovebomb as a manipulation tactic. So overall I know now, the signs were very clear and there since the beginning. I later realized I was operating off of trauma bonding.

What confuses me though, and this could just be me not fully understanding the extent of hurt that a narcissist is capable of, is that I would get him to open up to me after he seemingly felt safe in my presence, and I felt like I could clearly see when he took his “mask” off and presented me with his hurt inner child. He always told me he felt safe with me, and I feel like many times I could feel that he did. Could my feelings just have been disguised as hopefullness for his potential? Or can a narcissist ever share a true part of themselves to who they maybe would consider their “favorite”? I know that ultimately a narcissist is going to lie with no remorse so long as they receive what they want, but is their trauma and hurt stronger than their will to actually become better people?

I was honest with myself enough to get out and after our last phone call he cut off my goodbye and ended the call, so I know he’s hurt that his main supply was gone. (Note* we broke up because he was insecure about me being around other men).

I left without telling him out of fear of him preventing me from leaving (standing behind my car or taking the keys), not allowing our son to come with me, or even manipulating me to stay and “work things out.” He very much fits the description of narcissism, borderline personality disorder and emotional abuse and our 5-year long relationship has been very draining and almost always unhealthy. We are currently taking turns having our son and I do believe I’ve made the right decision to separate as I do not want our little boy growing up in a toxic and negative environment. However, I am feeling immense guilt over the situation. This is definitely bad timing with Thanksgiving being this week, but I could not keep living in our home with things being the way they are.

(I didn’t have time to grab the pre packed things when I left) Obviously I didn’t tell him that because I don’t want to amplify his emotions even more or him to have resentment for my friend that helped me. 

Anyways, it just made me feel dirty, guilty and grimy for being so secretive. I realize that if he was a loving, rational and emotionally available partner we wouldn’t be in this situation, but I do feel compassion and empathy for the hurt he’s experiencing right now.

My partner and I (me-23F him-30M) have been together about two years. We moved in together almost a year ago, and that was when things started getting dark. 

Over time, he has gotten worse and worse and now I just expect him to yell at me over the smallest of things.

He has admitted that he knows he is mean to me, that he wants to be better, but makes no real efforts towards that end. And to be honest, I don’t really want him to get better… I could never love him again, I have grown to resent him so strongly, to be so afraid of him, I don’t think I would ever trust that he could treat me well.

I (33F) have been with my SO(44M) for almost 3 years. We have had an on again/off again relationship for over 10 years and have a 13yo together as a result. My SO also had 3 other kids (26M, 17F, and 6F) with 3 other women, but truly only has a relationship or any sense of involvement with the youngest. The 6yo is also the result of an on again/ off again relationship, where my SO bounced back and forth between me and her BM (bio-mom) for years. No cheating was involved by the way. I still have some unresolved issues and unfounded fears that he'll leave me again and go back to BM just to have his daughter in his life full-time again, even though it's clear that there is no romantic interest between the 2 of them, and he says that that would never happen. His relationship with 6yo's BM, within the past 3 years, have gone from HC to LC, with them communicating more and more, most recently with a (new to me) short FaceTime call between my SO, BM, and child (that was only about the child) that really made me uncomfortable and brought up a lot of insecurities for me, causing me to question if I can really endure the next 13 years (until 6yo is 18) of having to deal with the fact that my SO will have to have some sort of communication with this woman, who seems to be a trigger for me. My SO also thinks that it's OK to do ""family things"" with BM and 6yo, even though this has never (and may never) come up. Playing ""happy family"" is a deal breaker to me, but I haven't expressed this to my SO yet.

He is generally a very sweet, funny and loving guy but if we have an issue, particularly if it’s an issue I have with him, he becomes a person I don’t recognise. He shuts down and won’t communicate. I do notice he is trying harder to communicate with me but he tells me that he can’t understand my feelings at all, he thinks my feelings are crazy (and he is reluctant to share his own feelings). When I try to talk about an issue he will stop responding and leave the room at any moment (in previous years he’d leave the house entirely) but particularly if I start crying. He never apologises for his behaviour, nothing is ever his fault, he tells me that my emotions are not his responsibility. If asked, he will say that he feels sad that I am sad but he won’t make up for his behaviour or console me. We end up in a situation where I find myself apologising in depth to him and trying to make him feel better (which I don’t think he even wants but I become desperate for things to be “okay” between us). I have, in the past, confessed to my partner that I think his behaviour may be emotionally abusive but he responded that he thinks that I am the emotionally abusive one and this has left me feeling confused and concerned (I definitely don’t intend to be abusive!)

His parents dismissed advice to get him assessed for autism as a child so he is undiagnosed and never had support for it. So when he shuts down (basically gives me the “silent treatment”) i’ve accepted it in case he is just genuinely overwhelmed. His mum has Borderline Personality Disorder (amongst other mental health issues) and he grew up witnessing a lot of trauma and abuse in his family home which he never got support with and doesn’t like to talk about. I do feel he has been traumatised and emotionally neglected as a child and understand that disagreements or heightened emotions could be triggering for him which, again, is why i’ve accepted his behaviour all these years

I am the only person that sees this side of him, I don’t confide in our friends and family for fear of ruining their perception of him and our relationship 

I would appreciate the thoughts of a stranger, thanks

7401,"Help me figure this out, please","My past posts have a history of where things have been with my long-distance partner, with whom I have a bit of an age difference. I’m the younger one, 31F. He is 40.

Two weeks ago, I got frustrated with him for not making any time to talk to me, and that blew up into him going to therapy and figuring out that because of his health concerns, he wasn’t sure about staying with me. The next day, it became because of our age difference (?) he wasn’t sure about staying. He says the two are related. He wants to step back from things he says to focus on health. That said, he won’t give me a definite no to the relationship. I of course want to make it work so I don’t push him in that direction either. 

He also says he is work-centric which means that “anything that comes in the way of work, I push away.” (In this case me being the thing.) In these two weeks alone, I’ve seen him ignoring me for days because he needs to step back or focus on work, while he takes on new professional assignments, goes out for drinks with his friends, meets new people etc. Whenever I ask him to tell me if his reason is as simple as he’s met someone new or he’s bored of me, he says no, I’m the second most important person in the world and that’s why he is unsure he can do this anymore with me. But he ignores me, tells me he is burdened by my expectation of staying in touch somewhat regularly. He says he will not be able to keep himself from having sex when we meet, so it’s best we don’t meet. But he would love to stay friends with me, but he is also unsure if we can be something more. He says btw it’s not just you, I’m the same way with my son (from a past relationship) too. How is that better? Make it make sense. 

I’m over here anxious and trying to make sense of what’s happened. His life I think is normal, more than. None of this screamed emotional abuse until my friend told me this - that she thinks this is emotional abuse.

7402,I (27 F) feel doomed for only attracting abusive partners,"I am kind and loving with a big heart. Somehow I only attract toxic partners. I believe this has to do with me expecting the bare minimum and having abandonment issues. I fall in love easily because I know what I want, always have. I have low self worth; yet also know my worth and what I have to offer at the same time. 

I have mommy and daddy issues. My father was an addict and passed away and my mother a narcissist who abused only me. My role was trying to save my father when no one else would even speak to him. We were close and this was the biggest devastation in my life next to a decade of even more trauma. I’ve dealt with addicts in previous relationships. I have low self esteem despite years of building myself up. I am the happiest and healthiest I’ve ever been from changing my lifestyle and putting the work in. That’s what I’m wanting in return but not attracting. 

I have only been in seriously abusive relationships. The first two were obviously abusive from pretty early on. I also loved the chase during my younger years even though I only want one loyal partner. That is truly all I have ever wanted. I did not even cheat during these awful relationships. I knew what I was involved with but stayed years longer than I should have. 

The most recent relationship I left (not an addict) was only one year. He maintained an almost perfect facade up until the end when I found out he was cheating on me. We were also planning to start a family and move in together. Luckily I stayed in my apartment. I am just baffled by the fact that I didn’t notice the red flags. Was in love and didn’t notice since his manners remained and he kept his act up until it turned into emotional abuse as well and I saw him for who he was. I’m heartbroken and feeling devastated that this still happened despite all the hard work that I invested in myself. I truly wanted different this time. 

I’m already afraid of being deceived or attracting another abuser in the next relationship. I’m afraid this is my fate since I didn’t grow up in a normal environment and have suffered so much abuse sometimes the lines are blurred between normalcy and abuse and I don’t always recognize it immediately. All I want is something healthy and real. I feel doomed that I haven’t been in one healthy relationship up until 27 years old and I’m scared I will never attract someone genuine.",no,no,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

I have an amazing family who rallied together to get me out, it took less than a day to empty the place. Removal van took everything to storage. I’m staying at my mums.

7415,"My abusive ex passed away, and I don't know how to feel","Hi all, 

As the title says really. My abusive in every way possible ex passed away on Christmas day, and I'm having mixed feelings. I finally left out 8 year relationship, 6 years ago, we have two children together, so he's been around for pretty much my entire adult life. 

Well, his girlfriend (ex?) Called me to let me know on boxing day. Turns out she left him the week before and he was alone on Christmas day when it happened. 

I'm so confused as to how I feel. On the one hand, I feel so much relief! I don't have to keep looking over my shoulder, and me and the kids can actually move on with our lives. 

Then I feel so much anger towards him, he was out on bail, and there was a huge chance of him going to go to prison for the stuff he did to me and his new ex, we're never going to get the justice we deserve.

After the anger, I feel guilt, I was wishing for something like this to happen for so long, and maybe it's one of those 'if you wish hard enough, it will happen' scenario (I know it's unlikely, but still the thought crosses my mind and I feel guilty) 

And finally, there's a little bit of sadness. At the end of the day, it's because of him that I have my beautiful children, and there were some happy memories (few and far between, but they're still there) but with the sadness, comes feeling like an idiot. Surely I shouldn't be sad about the death of someone who tortured and tormented the kids and I, and continued to do so after we left? 

I've tried talking to my partner about it, and he tries to be understanding, but he doesn't really get it. He thinks that I should just be happy, but he does sit and listen to me. Does anyone understand how I feel, or am I actually being silly about it? 

Sorry if it's a lot, I just needed to get it out, I'm not even sure if it makes much sense, this is literally a condensed version of my thoughts on my way into work. If you did get this far, thank you for taking the time to read. Don't feel like you have to reply, I just needed to let it out in a place where someone might understand how I'm feeling.",yes,no,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
7417,"One step forward, two steps back.","Sometimes, I get this huge wave of realisation come over me. I need to get out immediately and get somewhere safe for me and my baby. I think to myself, I need to leave right now. I get all hyped up and I think maybe things will be ok if I just got up and left, didnt take anything with me. 

Then it’s like this little voice inside me says that’s hilarious, you have nowhere to go. You can’t survive out there on your own. 

Anyone else ever experienced this? Most days I don’t want to leave, but the occasional day where I feel strong enough to just go, there’s nowhere to run and I have no money either. 

I feel like a bad person because the child and family agency is involved (due to me telling someone he has choked, grabbed, hit me while pregnant). He gave me a place to live, he has spent hundreds on me and the baby. He is portraying the image of an amazing boyfriend and father to be, only for me to get him in trouble like this and risk homelessness? I feel like I’ve shot myself in the foot. But part of me knows this is not ok. In the back of my mind I am waiting for him to hit me. Because until then, I’m in a happy, healthy relationship right? At the same time, deep down I know things will get worse with time, but what’s fucked up is I want to fast forward through all this pain and torture, fast forward to when he is ready to kill me. Men who choke their partners are 750% more likely to kill them right? I see no hope and I want him to kill me so this will all be over.

 But I know this is my fault because I should either break up with him and be happy, or stay with him and be happy. I don’t feel human anymore, I feel like an empty shell. I’m asking for advice on this subreddit but it’s not helping because I am not taking any action. He loves me so much and things aren’t bad enough for me to leave. He gives me everything.

7420,My fiancé strangled me (TW includes SA),"I (26F) have been with my fiancé (24M) for 5 years now. Through this time period I have been going through a lot of trauma therapy as I went through over a decade of child abuse and as a result have been diagnosed with Complex PTSD. My partner has mostly been supportive of my healing, but now that I’m doing a lot better he has become abusive towards me. 

My psychologist suggests that he might be afraid of losing me, so he’s trying to keep me unwell so that I don’t feel I can leave. I haven’t told her much about how he treats me (just that he’s controlling and we fight a lot) but she’s picked up on my non-verbal responses and has told me she’s concerned. I want to tell her so badly but I’m terrified of how everything will unfold. 

The truth is that he controls everything, doesn’t even allow me to have access to my own money. I literally have to ask for permission. I can’t go anywhere, most of my friends have been driven away… he has hit me multiple times. Then blames me for overwhelming him. He screams at me over the smallest of things. I have woken up to him touching me whilst I was sleeping. I told him I was not okay with that especially given my history. I have woken up to him doing it again since. 

Recently we got into an argument and he strangled me for the first time. He had such a scary look in his eye. I know logically I should leave, but it’s so deeply ingrained in me to stay and he knows that. He knows my CPTSD triggers and has been taking advantage of them. I wish I never told him about my trauma.

7423,Need to discuss comments from my partner,"I posted this on r/vaginusmus, and was recommended this subreddit.

For context - I suffer from vaginismus.

Often while having sex, I'd clarify if I wanted to try penetration (never successful yet) or if I just wanted to stick to our hands. This hadn't been a problem previously.

However, last year I said I wanted to stick to hands one evening. He agreed. But he ""got carried away"" as he says and tried penetration. Obviously it wouldn't go in, and I told him ""I said no, I don't want to try that"". We carried on, and he tried about two more times. I stopped and got really upset as I felt it was, of sorts, attempted rape. I kept saying no and pushing him away, but he kept trying.

I tried to get over it. I thought I was doing better. Not long after, I became pregnant (at home artificial insemination). Since giving birth earlier this year, my feelings from back then have resurfaced. I've told him I don't want any sexual contact at all. I'm not even that comfortable with hugs, but I feel it'd make him angry so I just try to limit them.

Now to the main issue regarding vaginusmus:
Yesterday, I decided to bring up what happened last year. 
He said ""I don't think it would have happened if you didn't have vaginusmus""
Me: ""So you're saying you assaulted me because I have vaginismus?""
Him: ""No, just if you didn't have vaginismus I don't think you'd have said no, so it wouldn't have been a problem""
Me: ""No, I might still have said I just wanted to use hands""
Him: ""You don't KNOW that though. I don't think you'd have said no""

He refused to clarify anymore, saying that I wouldn't understand and would just twist his words.

He told me he's ashamed of what he did,  but it frustrates him to talk about it. He said he can't stop me talking to my friends about it, but he'd rather I didn't as it would upset/frustrate/disappoint him. Only one friend knows so far.

I just feel I need to talk this out and get some other peoples opinions.

7424,Emotional reactivity as a survivor of DV,"I have had the most gut wrenching realisation today. I escaped a 9 year long DV relationship with my ex, which included physical, sexual, financial and emotional abuse. I have been with my current partner for 4 years, and he is a kind, rational and empathetic man. He has supported me through my lowest stages and has taken on my two children who have equal trauma to me.

We argue sometimes. Or to be more accurate I get defensice and argue until he shows any sign of frustration or arguing back and then I act like hes being abusive.

I realised today that I am still in the cycle of abuse, only this time I am the perpetrator. I am so stuck in the victim mentality that I completely missed I am the one keeping it going. 

Now I am terrified I've realised too late and I'll drive this wonderful human away and hurt him in ways he didn't deserve. 

Has anyone else faced this?? How did you begin to heal? I don't want to be this person,  I don't want to raise my kids still watching the cycle. I'm so scared that I didn't even see who I was becoming.

All the literature I can find talks about the men as perpetuating abuse, and women being reactive to the abuse. Noone seems to talk about vixtims becomong abusers. I feel sick even writing that.

He convinced me to drop the OOP, and I did. I was moving 1000 miles away three days after anyhow. That night, the yelling started again. He called the police and they asked me to leave the house. He wouldn’t let me back in. I got a police escort to pack my belongings and move. But he would not let me take all of my things, claiming they were his, and the police could do nothing because it is a “civil matter.” He wouldn’t let me take my dog. I was showing the police the receipt. It didn’t matter. Things my work bought for my home office, wouldn’t let me take those. My furniture I brought into the house, not that either.

He was an angry alcoholic behind closed doors but during family gatherings he presented very timid and nice. Which shocked everyone and nice I began speaking about the abuse I was experiencing. Although we dated for 7 years he never bought me flowers or took me out on dates and would often complain about not having money but how he was trying to get his act together. He would guilt trip me for asking more from him but when I would get the courage to leave him he would begin to cry and say he was going to change. I experienced financial, physical, and an intense amount of psychological and emotional abuse in this relationship and he made me believe that these behaviors were normal.

Some how he got me to change my mind and I let him come.

I went in for scan, they must have been confused to why i came  bk on my own, i was so embarrassed. Another lady joined us, they told me my baby had no heartbeat.

So about a month ago now me and my sons father had a altercation that caused me to call my mom to come pick me up because he would not let me have my car to leave when I did not feel safe. He did not put his hands on me, however, he was threatening me screaming and continued screaming in the front yard in front of neighbor is when I attempted to leave. The first two weeks of me staying here was rough and he continued being verbally abusive. However, since then it has died down and he has calmed down and is begging me to come back and being nice. I have stayed strong, even though it’s so hard.

Currently, he is still staying in our family home, which is in my name.. I told him over the last month. I needed some time to think during this time. I ran through a lot of things that went on over the past five years that I didn’t realize were abuse. of ourse I am hopeful he can get better, but I know it will take a lot of time if it even happens. We are now at this place where he is saying that he is going to get an apartment if I am not coming home which I know is genuine because I know the person he is renting it from. I really wanted him to get an apartment with the intentions that he could work on himself since he says he wants to and we could have space. But now, since I am moving forward with making him get the apartment he is telling me he is going to continue to work on himself but has no desire to work on things with me since I am “kicking him out” I know I shouldn’t even want to work on things but it’s just hard because I was hopeful, I feel like this is wrong and I feel like if he genuinely wanted to be with me and loves me thar he would take this time apart and really try and make things better for himself and ultimately us.

I asked him how he felt about what I was telling him and he asks me “how am I supposed to feel about it?” As if he just didn’t care. I’m almost at my breaking point.

7461,I bit my boyfriend's finger and he chocked me,"I know the title sounds bad but please hear me out. Me and my boyfriend have been together for a year and a half and were about to get married. Our relationship from my perspective was good. It wasn't always the greatest as he would yell at me sometimes but would also do everything he can to make me happy. I have always been a little afraid of him (my anxiety) as he has some anger issues and to combat his anger issues I guess I brought on mine.

 The day it happened we were arguing about a dress I wanted and he thought it was ridiculous that I wanted that dress and he let me know not to stress him out in the morning. He made some hurtful comments and went silent for 20 minutes. After those 20 minutes he suddenly came towards to hug me and I out of nowhere got really angry and bit his finger. I have some anger issues too but I've never bit him. After I bit him he choked me for around 5 secs. I started crying after that as I was so shocked and he was trying to console me but I just wouldn't stop. I packed half of my stuff and left to go to a friends house. He was obviously crying and said that it was self defense as that came out of nowhere and it hurt. 

He's been calling and saying he's sorry and has sought professional help for his anger issues. he's also apologizing to me about his verbal abuse in the past as he realizes now how horrible he was. He knew he had issues but not to this extent and feels very guilty and he's ashamed of himself. After not speaking for a week or so, I said that we should wait 4 months so he can work on himself and get help and I can do the same and maybe see if this is worth another shot. I feel like his effort is genuine and that he is very apologetic but I keep seeing this stat of how women who have been chocked by their partner are more likely to die and I'm just so scared. I don't know what to do. I love him and I feel like it was my fault too. I have so many mixed feelings and I remember that day and think about being with him and sometimes I think it'll be okay if both Him and I work on ourselves sincerely but at the same time it just makes me so angry. I'm just not sure what to do. I know I def need help professionally and plan to get it but I keep asking myself If he did that only on self defense. He said that it just happened very quickly and can we recover from this down the line in 4 months? Can someone really change?

7468,I get scared when my abusive partner initiates sex. I was visibly tense and nervous while we were kissing today,"I say he’s my partner but we’re actually in relationship limbo. He’s spends his Saturdays with some “female friend” who btw “has a boyfriend” or hanging out with his ex or someone else. I’m always stressed trying to figure out who’s he’s plotting on now. It leaves me extremely anxious.

On top of this we’re always on and off. When I try to leave he finds a way back in and forces us to have sex. There have been a couple disturbing things he’s done recently related to sex. The first being that if I try to get some space and say I’d rather just be alone tonight, he’ll show up at my place anyway. I used to think it was cute but it’s actually stressing me out.

If I’m already in his presence and I verbally express that I don’t want to have sex he’ll just keep pushing until I give in or he just pleasures himself in front of me which makes me extremely uncomfortable. One time he finished on me and put a pillow over my face because I probably looked distraught.

The few times I’ve said no and held my ground (when he’s not near me) he’s gotten extremely upset and went on a full on rage. Just cursing me out and calling me selfish. It just makes me scared of what he might do if I actually leave him for good. He’s a pretty explosive and confrontational type of person with just about everybody.

I say all this to say that today he started kissing me and I felt like I started tending up and pulling away. He always takes my head and pulls me in so we can’t stop kissing unless he wants to. When he pulled away he asked me if I was okay because I looked really tense. I just told him I get a little worked up but I actually wanted to tell him to stop and run.

I just don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. I do love him but I’m also afraid of him and really drained from his lack of commitment/reciprocity. I feel like his punching bag. If I leave him, I have to do it when I move to a new undisclosed location.

7469,I feel incapable of having another relationship,"I know how short-sighted and silly this might sound but it's something I've been struggling with.

I was abused by my last boyfriend from 19 to 21. It fucked up my life. I've been out for over a year and I've been trying to get help.

I told myself that I wouldn't date again for a long time after him, and I haven't. I still have no desire to meet people or ""start over"" in that sense. Part of it is wanting to be alone for the sake of healing, and part of it is just feeling scared of relationships, to the point where I've pushed away everyone who's taken interest in me in the last year.

I'm not scared of getting hit again. I'm more scared of losing myself again or getting stuck, losing sight of my goals and plans for someone who's going to eventually leave me. Getting left in general. Feeling fucked up and toxic and difficult to love. Hurting someone because I wasn't able to trust them, etc.

I do crave intimacy, and I fill the hole with casual sex (usually with a single partner, like a fwb). I want to be loved and to be able to provide love, because I know that I have a lot of it to give. I just feel like I will never get to the point where the idea of a relationship doesn't make my stomach turn over. But the casual sex hurts too in the long run, and I sometimes watch my friends start and end relationships and I wish that I could just stop being scared.

I know I have time, but for example right now there's a person I would love to just not be afraid to let in. He's good and he would be patient with me. But my brain keeps saying no.

7473,"Deeply affected by my partner's ""negative"" moods","First of all sorry if anything sounds confusing, I am on mobile and english is not my first language.

So, I was in an extremely abusive relationship between 2017-2020, in which my abuser would constantly, among other things, lash out on me and take out his negative emotions on me. Because of that I became hyper aware of his mood swings and things that could upset him, and would be constatly be on edge and anxious if he displayed any signs of being upset.
Well, fast forward to now, about 3 years out of that relationship and currently 2 years in a very healthy, loving and comfortable one. My current boyfriend and I are in a long distance situation while I get my degree on another state. We only get to see each other every 3 or 4 months when we manage to make time in between college and work. Right now he is visiting on what we initially planned to be a 3 week trip, but he just found out his classes are staring earlier than expected, forcing us to cut his visit short by one week. This clearly affects us both, but mostly him, who's now anxious about having to rearrenge all of the details of his trip back home. 
Altough he doesn't display any of the behaviours my ex did, he is still human, and upsetting things like this make him, well, upset, and that affects his behaviours like it would any healthy human being. Problem is: I am still as affected by his mood as I was by my abusive ex's. This is something that has come up before in our relationship and we discussed openly, since he knows my history with abuse. He always say that he is open to comfort and reassure me in these situations no matter how upset he might be, which means a lot to me, but I still feel bad about needing comfort when he's the one going throught all that stress.
And also, I have been out of that abusive situation for 3 years now, doing therapy, visibly improving in all other aspects of my mental health and.the scars left by that experience, but this is the one thing does not seem to improve, no matter what. It's like a war flashback or something. It has come up in my therapy sessions a lot and will again, but I just wanted to ask, does anyone else still experiences that even years after the abusive situation, withouth change? Does it ever get better? Will I live with this for the rest of my life?

7479,I'm (33F) being constantly abused by my parents and he (M36) said I'm too negative and don't see beauty in life,"It's been about a year I'm in a kind of LDR with a man from another country.
He is a war vet. He has experienced terrible things, got PTSD, I totally understand it. 
I am a divorced mother, who had to come back to mentally abusive parents due to financial reasons, and after coming back I've experienced terrible mental, emotional, financial and all kinds of non physical abuse. I'm also quite isolated socially. One of the reasons is that my parents use the child (babysitting) to not let me go out and see my friends/work/study, so i'm in a loop. My parents, especially my mother, abuse me terribly (they are good to the kid though), it was even worse a year or 2 ago. Also I live in a country where there are always r*cket attacks, t*rror att@cks, now a group of radicals took the gov and people are being afraid that d*mocracy is collapsing. I'm afraid for my son's and my own life and safety. 
That's more or less the story of my life. I HAVE reasons to be afraid, to want support, to want my partner or even a friend to calm me down. Obviously it wasn't one sided - he shared his experiences, what he's been going through, I was always supporting him.
As time went by, he got colder and more distant. 
And today was the first time he agreed to talk about it. He said I don't see the beauty in life. That I only see negatives, that he has seen much worse things.
I said I totally understand that objectively my life is not as bad as of people in serious w@r hit countries, but subjectively for me, what I go through is enough of a reason to be afraid or to be sad. It doesn't mean I don't see beauty, actually that's one of the things I always post on my IG but he is not there. Like, flowers and rainbows in times of darkness.... But I thought THE POINT of being together is to support each other.
He told me a few times before that, that I was ""overthinking""/""overreacting""/""too stressed"", I obviously understood it's wrong to say so.
I have the right to feel whatever I feel.

I don't get it... did I have to talk to him about ""positive things"" only? Funny videos, flowers and rainbows? What about the idea of a team that overcomes everyghing together and makes each other stronger and feel better? 

I'm not anxious about him leaving me for whatever reason, if we're not compatible it's totally normal, it's life🤷🏻‍♀️. I can survive all that without a man's support🤷🏻‍♀️, but his words just make me feel devalued, like he says that my needs have to dimimish, my emotions have to diminish, etc.

7480,Is this abuse? Please help.,"Posting with a throwaway since I haven't talked to friends/family about this yet: 

I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for 1.5 years. 75% of the time things are good and he is caring and loving. The other 25% of the time he has anger outbursts, calls me names, and is generally upsetting to be around. Recently, I've been thinking about the possibility of this being abuse. 

Some specific examples: 

* Extreme anger outbursts over small things (standing in the way, dropping something, etc.) that leads to him raising his voice at me significantly to the point where I am usually crying. 
* If I cry from his yelling, he will often call me dramatic, tell me ""I'm acting like a child"", and to ""grow up.""
* When he yells, I will often ""shut down."" This will usually cause him to be more angry and tell me that I'm ""not allowed to do that to him.""
* During these anger outbursts sometimes calling me stupid, an idiot, annoying, infuriating, having one brain cell, etc. 
* When he has these anger outbursts and ends up yelling at me, he typically will blame me saying that ""he's only yelling because I don't listen"" and what I did (ex: accidentally standing in his way) shows that ""I don't care about him.""
* Has isolated me from my friends by convincing me that they don't care about me, are not good people, etc. 
* Does not want me to go out on weekends or on vacation with my girl friends. 
* Has on two occasions pushed/shoved me out of his way when he has these anger outbursts (I was not injured).  
* When trying to lose weight, has suggested that I'm only trying to lose weight so I can cheat on him (I have never cheated on him or any past partners).
* Gets angry when we are not intimate as much as he would like. Will accuse of me of not being attracted to him. 

After these events he will act like nothing every happened and just carry on as normal. I avoid standing up for myself in these situations due to fear of making it worse. 

I'm looking for advice/opinions on whether or not this is abuse. I've never dealt with things like this before. I do still love him very much, though these things are making me reconsider if this is what I want for the rest of my life. It would be difficult to leave him since we live together and have pets.

It’s  important to know that we’ve been long-distance for 2 1/2 years and have only been living together for five months and the things that are hurting me daily I generally take care of myself. He is not my caretaker at all, and he doesn’t hear about it every time that there is something wrong.

There was physical, sexual, emotional and financial abuse. The end of the relationship was very messy and ended in a miscarriage and restraining order. After months of court I decided to not press charges due to the amount of hassle it took. I was balancing school, work and a lot of personal stuff and did what was best for me at the time. I ended up moving several times since the three years we broke up. I switched cars, jobs and locations. I moved on & I thought my ex did too. Both my ex and I entered long term relationships and have been with our partners for over three years. Which is why I was shocked when a “friend” of my ex told me that my ex moved to the same small town as my bf. I thought it could be a coincidence but was reminded by my bf that all of my food delivery apps were hacked about 2/3months before my ex moved. I tried to just ignore it and chuck it up to coincidence but I saw my ex for the first time in 3yrs and from the look of joy on his face I now am certain this is not a coincidence. I haven’t told my bf but I am now certain my ex moved a block away from him. I do not live with my bf but from my social media you would not know that. I rarely put my home address on any paperwork or deliveries. I am no longer frighten of my ex but I don’t want to live with the burden of his existence anymore. I’m tired of him stalking my life.

He has copied almost everything I’ve done in my current relationship that I post online. I just don’t know what to do at this point.

After that, I couldn't find them had to use another pair that is the wrong prescription, too tight, unattractive, and causes migraines for me, for a week. 
I was ripping up the place (hanger in the couch cushions style) trying to find my good pair of glasses. My partner noticed, and helped me look for about an hour. After that, I had given up on finding them. 
My partner then said they had found them! I asked where? They said under their mattress. I asked why? They said they didn't remember putting them there, they blacked out drunk.

 I'm not sure it's abuse because they apologized and explained that they didn't know where they were because they blacked out. We both have had our share of alcohol abuse, and I've done wrong in the past. I can't help but feel that I deserve this.

7510,Playing a losing game,"Soooo narcissistic partner recently got a job (hooray!) It’s working 6 hours 6 days a week. Doesn’t pay much but I figure anything is better than nothing…and he got paid this week a couple hundred bucks. Which I thought was good because he can chip in a bit to help cover weekly expenses like groceries, our daughter’s needs, or even small household items. I guess that’s impossible. What does he do? Buy weed. 🫠

He never even asked “what do we need for the week, what items can I help out with?” Let alone buy milk or diapers for our daughter…

He puts a couple dollars of gas in the tank, but that’s about it. Mind you, he’s driving my car around and I’m having to ask my parents to pick me up from work. I’ve been paying the bulk of our living expenses and kept praying he’d get a job. 

I guess expecting him to help was a little too much to hope for. Of course, his needs are always priority. As a mom I couldn’t dare to spend money without covering our bills and kids needs first.

I feel like no matter what, he’ll continue to drain my resources and he doesn’t see where/why I’m angry with him…he doesn’t bother to clean the apartment or try to help unless he wants to. I’m tired of treating him like a child and expecting him to help me out with anything….

I’m frustrated and angry, he is really good at taking and taking….I just want him to leave. I’m kicking myself for letting him back in after 6 months. Those 6 months, I wish I stayed strong and kept him away.

7511,"Covert narc partner: punish you by bending over backwards for others, while neglecting you?","My wayward husband (he had/has an EA with a coworker) is a covert narc, in addition to likely having OCPD. He'll never get a diagnosis, because he is not honest with his therapist. The only reason he's going to therapy is because it was my condition of reconciliation, after his EA and dating app use).

Anyway, I thought I was crazy for the 20 years we've been married, but I now realize that covert narc wayward husband will go out of his way to do things for others, almost aggressively advertising how helpful and wonderful he is, while acting as if the most simple task at home is too much, and I am too demanding. Some examples:

* WH (wayward husband) will spend an entire weekends cleaning out his mom's hoard. She just re-hoards.
* He will ""lend"" money to coworkers (and never get it back…large sums).
* He will drive for hours to act as his sister's date to events and outings (She is in her late 40s and has never dated).
* He will spend endless hours and money curating thoughtful gifts and experiences for his emotional affair partner.
* He will stay late at work for hours and hours to pick up others' slack; he's a manager and refuses to delegate.
* He always takes on the worst work schedule for himself.
* He can magically get time off work to do things with his sister, but if I don't give him 6 months' notice, he ""can't"" get the day off.
* He always has a compliment for his emotional affair partner/coworker. I haven't heard a compliment from him from before we got married, 20 years ago.

If you're with a covert narc, do they make sure to lavish others with time, attention, money, and help, while denying you even the most basic levels of assistance, affection, and sex?

He's always sounded jealous or competitive  or something, of my multiple orgasms.

I'm very familiar with my body and can get myself off pretty quick - so even though he has zero focus on my pleasure during sex and it's all about him even since pretty early on, I was still getting off more than once usually, by the time he did.  He would ask how many times... but, I always sensed a bit of resentment in it.  Which was weird because with previous partners I remember it always being something they were kind of... proud of? excited by? in awe of? .... not this weird resentment or competitiveness about it.

Then again, past partners usually contributed more to the feat than he does... so I guess it makes sense!

More recently he has actually started asking me to move my hand out of the way because  it's getting in his way and killing his focus on getting off 🤣  like... what??!  You can't... change positions or something, instead of trying to deny me any pleasure from the act???

7517,Can he be a narcisstic partner?,"For 3 years, I've been with a man who doesn't celebrate my birthday, even though he knows and sees it on social media and I remind him. We have a long distance relationship. I have always celebrated his birthday, I celebrated his birthday at 12 o'clock at night, but last year I purposely didn't and he forced me to celebrate his birthday. On his birthday, he responded to my messages that he didn't respond to before and started a conversation with me. I celebrated his birthday even if it was forced.

Today is my birthday. I sent him a video of my early birthday celebration the day before. He knows it's my birthday. But he didn't even reply.

So I sent him a message like this;

""It's my birthday today, you don't write to me. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Because you are allergic to making me happy and kindness 🤣🤣🤣🤣""

and then I added it;

""Anyway, it doesn't matter. I got you figured out.""

I suspect he's a narcissist. He talks about himself all the time, he never asks me what I'm going through. We had a huge earthquakes, and in those days he was texting me and talking about himself. We were on the street for 3 months-homeless (We are fine, our city was neighboring the area where the earthquake happened. We lived on the 10th floor and couldn't go home because of the aftershocks, but we stayed outside with our cats for 3 months). He didn't care. He didn't even ask how we were doing.

My father has suspected cancer. I asked him to help me look for a doctor. He didn't even ask me how he was doing and tell “get well soon”.

He avoids controversy and practices ghosting and greystone a lot.

Our conversations are always one-sided... He praises himself and his achievements and then acts humble when I praise him. Our relationship became serious very quickly.

He seems to like my attention, not me. He said he expects too much attention from his partners.

He makes big promises and doesn't keep any of them. It's a disaster from top to bottom.
Then I did some research and I suspected he might be a narcissist.

I have reset all my expectations about him and this last birthday opened my eyes.

I started reading about narcissism, and he looks like a narcisstic to me.

I’m proud and energized by those of you sharing survival stories and making decisions to leave unhealthy relationships. 

Today has been a sad and challenging day for me. I could use some words of encouragement from those of you who got through discard, separation, divorce, all while knowing your partner had someone else……those of you who were left, but had not fully given up yet. 

The more I learn and the more I can stay in connection with my Self, the more certain I am that there is nothing left for me with this person. 

That said, the level of detachment and just not actually giving a $&?! about me and my feelings after so many years on the pedestal is disorienting and confusing. 

I have a very good therapist, I am privileged to have time for self care, I continue to read and learn more on my journey. Even still, the pain of discard and feeling of not having been “enough” still lives in me. 

I assume this will take years. I know on average grief takes 1-2 years to get through on average, but we carry some of it forever. Do I have years is this ahead of me?

7527,Is feeling of acceptance and safety of the table with a covert narc?,"Wondering…is there such thing as feeling accepted, loved, appreciated and where soul feels safe and at home…with a covert narc?

Still figuring out if my spouse is a narcissist, I am thinking I can connect him with 70% of things on podcasts/youtube about coverts so there is something here.

Not sure if this is only my childhood trauma but also dynamic of this relationship but I NEVER felt like I arrived at a safe space with him. Like all the nagging, criticism, putting me down, etc etc - made me feel like I am never enough. Always coming short. If I clean I neglect my kid, if I play with our kid the house is dirty and I am messy bad housewife….My narc never let me be human, make human mistakes…there was always frawning upon little mistakes I did. Frawning upon for such little things. Rude and unpleasant interactions.

I recently did a smaller financial miscalculation and went into minus on my bank account. I work 10 years+ and this was the first time… never felt safe to share this with him but asked my mom for a small loan.

I KNOW this is wrong, since I have a partner. But his relationship towards me I think made me unable to become vulnerable and make mistakes and come to him when such things happen.

…I feel my partner is not my self place to land. I don’t feel I get the support and mostly he would just made me feel worse about myself about doing a mistake.

Is this a common feeling in na narcy relationship? Not having that feeling you can be you, you have someone who will be a team and have yout back? That your spouse is yout best friend…who will not put you down or even make you feel worse if you make a mistake.

I imagine in a healthy relationship I would share stuff like that with my partner, he would be a first one to know if I made any kind of mistake. Not to say I am not guilty but to say: oh you made a mistake, you will learn from it, I have your back babe, don’t worry.

Adding: partner doesn’t have any financial issues. We have split finances. I just came from maternity leave, working half time and having my own business so things are a bit slower…he is loaded with cash 

But being so closed and not able to share this with my partner without feeling anxious and waiting what he will say…this is not how it should be, right?",yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
7531,Can there be a good guy but only shitty to you kind of covert narc???,"Hello! This sub has been extremely helpful as I am trying to see if our dynamics sort of fit into the things discussed here.

My spouse is a good guy. Doesn’t lie, is a very hands on dad, very successful career, etc. I would say perhaps perfect on paper.

The thing that makes me think he MIGHT be a covert is his cronically bad mood, a lot of talking down to me, belittling me, criticizing me (and others). Yes he does likes things being his own way, but his relationship towards the world and morals are on point.

But when it comes to me I feel like I am never good enough. If I am present with kids the home is not clean, if I clean I am not present enough. Basically I think I cannot win. 

He also doesn’t have many deep relationships with friends, not really many friends.

Sex drive is very so so, and some erectile disfunction. I would say he is not a passionate partner. I don’t ever feel wanted, like he desires me (although my looks are good, average at least).

Mostly the thing is that I do human mistakes, forget to close the drawer etc and he is constantly nagging. And is a bit controlling.

But overall I think he is a good person. Just towards me I think things are not as they should be. I don’t feel respected, wanted, like I can be myself…

…but he doesn’t lie, cheat, steal, has never assaulted me, got into fights, no drugs no nothing. As clean as he can be.

That’s why I thought for 10 years I might be the problem all the time…since he doesn’t have any red flags…only what I stated. Moody, a bit of nagging, never happy…and relationship towards me is crappy 💔",yes,yes,yes,no,no,,no,no,plausibly,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,no,no
7536,Anyone else have problems with sex?,"In my experience with my SO… early on in our relationship, the love bombing phase, I told him that sex was really important to me and was a good healthy part of a relationship. Sex was frequent and amazing. Once we got past the love bombing phase he started withholding and asked me not to initiate because “now that I’m older I don’t want to feel like I’m put on the spot or have to perform”. Which in the beginning is plausible, because I was not aware yet of the manipulation. 

So our sexlife dwindled to maybe once every couple of months. 

Then I found sexts and pictures of his ex on his phone, to which he said nothing happened, but I don’t believe him. 

Ever since this, I’ve had a weird feeling, or have been hyper vigilant about his behavior/actions which lead me to continue to go through his phone, which also lead me to the discovery of his raging porn and masturbation addiction. (Over several decades he’s admitted to)

In my case, I believe he is withholding sex as a power play, he knows I want it, so he purposely ignores my needs. To add insult to injury he sometimes makes it abundantly clear that he has masturbated during the day, usually on days I’ve asked for or initiated sex and have been denied. 

Most of the books or research I’ve done usually says that CN men don’t care about their partners pleasure and sex is usually one sided with the woman left with no orgasm etc., I know withholding and his porn addiction technically falls into the category of not caring about the woman, but when we DO have sex it’s all about me, and how many times he can make me orgasm, so I’m really confused about the sex part.

7537,I just want someone to relate to,"Has anyone else ever experienced financial abuse from their narcissistic partner? Since we had our first child he has placed all of the children’s care on me preventing me from having my own funds. Here and there I have been able to get a part time job and when pat day comes he will say “you need to pay this bill” or “most of that check needs to come to me since I’ve been paying x and x”. He never gives me any money unless there is an absolute need and he will give me the exact amount needed for it. If I do ask him for money he is very mean and nasty about it and makes me feel like I can’t or shouldn’t ask so I just dont. He has a “change jar” which is more like a water jug and it’s filled with all 1$ 5$ bills and quarters and there is probably close to 1000$ in it. He will set it up to where he will know if it’s moved and sometimes I’ve been desperate enough for 5$ in gas or a pack of wipes that I will risk it and take a few dollars (never more than 5$) just to avoid asking him even though I know when he realizes I will be in for it. Tonight that happened. He looked at it and looked at me and I knew. He inspected it and came to the conclusion I had taken a 5$ bill from it bc he saw that particular one on the side the day prior. I did take it, I was running out of gas to get to my pt job and I was afraid to ask him. He locked me in the room and berated me calling me a thief a liar and a ungrateful bi***. He said I steal from the only person that does anything for me and he left and texted me that I needed to send him the money for my phone bill, which took all the money I had from my very very small paycheck but he threatened to cut my phone off if I didn’t. That is not an empty threat he cuts it off several times a year leaving me with no way to communicate with anyone including my kids when I’m gone. I texted back that I had sent it and said he scared our kids and his reply was “well if their mom wasn’t a sorry sack of sh** I wouldn’t have to act like that” as I sit here in the bathroom defeated, crying where my babies can’t see me I just want to feel heard and seen and I want to know that this isn’t normal.

7538,Wondering whether to fight him legally,"My 8-year relationship w/ N partner came unglued on Solstice night, when his Jekyll side appeared in full force, after I refused to go along w/ a scheme to withhold paying rent, and then I wouldn't apologize. We seemingly had heaven on earth for 8 years --- even that very Solstice day we shared hopes, dreams, and plans for a house we planning to buy. But that very night, he transformed into a demon-like force, unleashing his full fury by throwing my stuff around, breaking dishes, screaming, etc. I escaped early the next morning and am in a safe place.

I am clear that we are finished and there is no going back. Although I always knew he had narcissistic tendencies, I now understand that his seemingly good side was to keep the supply flowing. 

I got a lot of my stuff out of the house with the help of two relatives, but a lot remains there. Here's the legal quandary: We were never married, and we each owned precious metals individually -- silver and gold. My relatives helped me get my portion of the silver. It appears that my nex misplaced the stash of gold -- while there, I asked him where it is and he doesn't know . So I left without receiving it or knowing where it is. 

He's a ruthless fighter and may never stop. He's already begun the smear campaign. He is brilliant; very hi IQ. He now says I'm the enemy and he wants to destroy me. I realize that anything I do beyond gray rock or non-response will be perceived as escalation. 

Even with documentation to prove my gold ownership, I realize it may be very costly personally to attempt to get, even using the legal system. And my sense is that the legal bills to try to get the gold or current $ equivalent will be too costly compared to the 39 oz gold (currently around $80,000 value). Comments? Victories to share?

7541,Question,"When did you finally start to realize your partner was a narcissist or had narcissistic attributes?

I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately to the point I actually gaslight myself. I do this because it seems like he is really good at making himself not “be a narc.” There’s a lot more good days than bad days- and it’s easy to forget who he truly is. Actually as he gets older his personality is getting worse. 

When I was pregnant with our daughter he got mad at me about something and I left, and I got like ten messages about how a judge would never give me custody over him because he had a job. That was 14 years ago. Then i remember holding my ground, and remembered the messages I got from him lovebombing and apologizing.

I also realized he has lost quite a few good friendships he had. And I only ever hear his side.

I found an earring in his truck once. I confronted him and he made up this god awful story about how he found it on the ground. Then I got to listen to him tell his family (they were at our house) that I was fighting with him and accusing him of cheating and then replay his god awful story of the earring.

Another time at one of his work Xmas parties I got to watch another woman fix his shirt. No kidding. She like patted his chest. Lmao omg. Wow. He was smiling ear to ear.  

I wasn’t really strong when I was younger and I was really in love or at least thought I was. 

One time I got out of work at 7 and when I got home he was outside in my face about why I was an hour late. I was like I’m not late, I got done at 7 and it’s 7:12 right now what are you talking about? He went on to say he called the store I worked at and the auto machine said they closed at five. I said “but they don’t change the auto machine yet for the holidays even though we work extended hours.” Idk how he believed me after that, but then to make up for it he went to the store and bought milk so “I didn’t have to.” So generous 

Do you ever have these moments where you’re like dang I wish I would have caught that red flag? But information wasn’t so readily available and accessible at your fingertips even 14 years ago.

7548,Anxiety about Christmas,"I feel… really anxious about Christmas this year because it’ll be the first without my ex narc in my life. Not like he was ever really around for Christmas he always left to be with his dad’s side of the family… supposedly… but he’d at least call and we’d talk and before he left we’d exchange gifts and always hang out the day after. 
I don’t have a good relationship with my parents. And I don’t want to bug any of my friends on Christmas and be like 3rd wheeling with their family… but I don’t wanna be home. My dad’s also a narc. My mom is bipolar (I think not 100% on that one but she’s got serious issues too.) and it’s just hard to be around them without being triggered. I feel really sad to not have him or any partner to escape to on the holidays. I know I have to deal with it and my family cuz there’s no changing them. But it gives me anxiety to feel stuck with them and not even have anyone to vent to about how annoying or rude they are being and then knowing I’ll be with my person after.

7557,I think I just found out he cheated on me with a second girl,"I’ll try to explain this the best I can. Him and I went to a friend of his house and when we walked in he referred to me as Lucy which is not my name. A few minutes later, my partner accidentally called me Lucy which again was strange because he’s never called me by the wrong name before. I then found out my partner has known this person who’s house we were at for two years which is the length of our relationship. My partner explains that his friend only made the mistake because he still has my partners name and Lucy as the contact name for my partner. If this is the case, then my partner has to have been with this woman in the time that we have been together. I know there was overlap between me and another girl at some point. I was not aware that there may have been another girl. When I asked about it, he got very defensive and exclaimed that we have not been together for the entire two years which suggest to me that he’s trying to use inexclusivity as an excuse for having this relationship with another girl that I knew nothing about. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since. It’s driving me absolutely insane. I can’t believe there could possibly be another person that he has been seeing behind my back. I’m going to try and have a mature and civilised conversation with him about this which is possible but will be tricky.

7558,What he likes about me,"I was trying to talk to him about how I'm feeling disrespected because he never says anything nice about me, frequently calling me naive, inexperienced (I'm in my fifties, with a career, previous relationships, adult children), crazy, angry...all things no previous partner has said about me, or anyone else for that matter. 

I started first. I told him that he's very intelligent, can be a lot of fun, is loyal to his friends, has helped a lot of people through his life (including me), and has amazing skills to figure out how to fix just about anything. 

When it was his turn, he thought for a minute and then said ""You make the best jam and bread. You barbecue really well. You have the best (female anatomical part).  That's it. That's all he could say about me.  Not that I'm hardworking, empathetic, kind, intelligent.

I guess it shouldn't be surprising, but this time it really made me think,  probably because I just started reading Why Does He Do That? and this passage, in light of what my husband said, explains a lot:

""Abuse grows from attitudes and values, not feelings. The roots are ownership, the trunk is entitlement, and the branches are control.""

I'm NOT a person to him. Women aren't people to him.  What he likes about me are the things I can do for him and he only likes me when I keep my mouth shut and do things for him. 

A lot of my distress has been about the dissonance between him saying he loves me but constantly hurting, dismissing, and diminishing me.   Now I understand I absolutely have to leave.  Maybe he is mentally ill or has a personality disorder, but at the heart of it, he just BELIEVES I'm less than him.  If nothing about me has changed his mind on that yet, nothing ever will. 

I'm over 3,000 miles from home and I don't really have friends or family anymore.  I don't have much money because he's drained my savings.

7562,Toxic Jealousy,"     My bf and I’ve been together for 1 year and 6 months. And ever since, we’ve lived with one another 6 months in and still do. Just 6 months ago I’ve become apart of this Massage Program since I’ve always wanted to become a Massage Therapist. 
     Now that I’m doing it, my boyfriend asks me every time in class not to be paired with a guy. Asking me there age, what their name is and how long they’ve been in this program. It hasn’t stopped. Every massage class consists of hands on training and book work too. When I tell him that it’s purely for my education and for practice he overlooks that saying “I’ll only allow it for business practices.” 
      I’ll admit I’ve lied every class mentioning I’ve had a girl as my partner. It slips each time sometimes that I mention them as a guy. But I realize that I’m feeling ashamed out loud mentioning I’ve had a guy as a partner when I shouldn’t be!
     I even mention to him how he’s being controlling and his way of thinking is off. I continuously mention how it’s nothing but a professional job. But getting back to him being called controlling again, he told me “it’s just something you have to deal with.”
     And ik that it can stem from insecurities and lack of self-confidence, but I keep reassuring him each time that nothing’s gonna escalate and come from this PROFESSIONAL interaction. But even so, he says he wants me to keep reassuring him and I do even without him asking me. I keep repeating the process over and over. 
     He ends off with “I don’t care whoever you massage or partner with to practice,” when he clearly does, slamming our bedroom door in my face. 
     I’ve texted him again about this. And GUESS WHAT ☺️ he does care. Surprise surprise. Telling me how I was gaslighting him, how I don’t reassure him and that I’m toxic. Also, I can’t hang with any of my group of friends if there happens to be some surprise guy that shows up. He wants to know each time, who I’m with. 
     Even though I trust him with whoever he’s with or where ever! More to add on, we swing here and there as well and the most I do get “jealous” at him is when he does things he wouldn’t do to me, but does for them. I more get angry that I’ve told him these things beforehand and he crosses the boundaries than feeling jealous. 
     Because I also get the other girls can be different but when he does the specific thing he doesn’t do to me to them, I get angry.

Hi, 
I (34f) am with my partner (42m) for the past 11 years. 
We are very different people, he values his freedom of work and like to learn about all cities in the world and I'm very career driven. He comes from wealty-ish family and I paved my own path. We are completing each other.
We have a young child and have no family around (several thousands of km away), his family is very kind and visits regularly and mine is quite toxic. 
We found our balance and decided to go for a second child. 
We were just talking and I asked how he felt about getting a vasectomy after because the pills destroyed me each time. 
He explained that he didn't want to do it because, what if I were to die in a terrible accident tomorrow? What would he do? Or what if I were to disappear with our children?
I am very much lost right now. 
That he doesn't to go through the intervention, ok. It's his body, I just asked because we wanted to stop at 2.
The reasons are killing me a little bit. Like how? Why ? When have I even showed I would just pack and leave? I stopped talking and seeing my friends because he felt uncomfortable around them. I said no to some jobs because he wanted to stay here. 
I'm truly lost but maybe I am overreacting?
When I asked why these reasons, he cried. 
I asked for us to see a psychologist together for a couple therapy session, to try to speak with a third party and he refuses.
Am I just overreacting? Assuming wrong?

On the phone w him i asked him what meds his doctor prescribed he said fluoxetine (antidepressant) and abilify (antipsychotic). He couldn’t remember the names he had to go walk to his bathroom to read the pill bottles. He also told me he went to inpatient and now sees a new psychiatrist (he didn’t like his old one) he said he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, OCD, PTSD, and another one but he forgot

7588,My boyfriend of 5 years attacked me.,"I (25f) and my (26m) got into a fight last night about my daughter’s eating habits. She is 16m and doesn’t really like to try new foods. So I was going to just make her sandwich since she will eat that. We were verbally arguing and he got up and threw a remote control car cover at me. It hit me in the face and it set me off, I swiped the counter clean off and said get out. He ran over to me put his hands around my throat and threw me to the ground. I was in the fetal position on the floor scared for my life. He broke the silverware drawer I swear I thought he was going to grab a knife and kill me. He did say he was going to kill me. I’m so alone I don’t know what to do. It started off with small things like slapping to shoving to now almost ending my life. But he is a great dad and great to me when he wants to be. But today I’m left battered and bruised…. I need this to be a wake up call. I’m not sure what I need to do next. Please don’t judge I’m having a really hard time and really hard time trying to figure this out.

7594,My boyfriend is mad at me because im upset he 'cheated',"Basically i found some vids on his phone.....

some people might think its cheating some might not. But to us it is, because at the beginning of our relationship my boyfriend said that watching onlyfans and p\*rn is cheating so dont do it. i was like ok fine and i never did, only to find out yday he has been watching throughout the relationship. 

found out he had a reddit account full of onlyfans, but the thing that really annoyed me was that it was muslim girls etc. esp arabs.... he has a fetish for arab muslim girls which is the only reason hes with me. i find it so disgusting and degrading. When i saw the videos it make me sick to the pit of my stomach. some vids were even spying on girls in changing room. 

when i confronted him he lied so much, first he said it was a prank then he said he was looking for this one famous arab nude he couldnt remember her name so he clicked on every reddit post.... but i know this is a lie too because he said he was looking for a photo but the posts were all vids. 

.... and after he apologised he expected me to be ok with it all but i wasnt, i was still sad so he went out and got us food and treats to make up for everything (cus when he goes out he never does this) .... i wasnt in the mood to eat so he threw all the food on the floor and screamed at me. 

today he was like you feed me my food.. trying be all romantic and that, he tried to kiss me and everything but honestly im so disgusted by him. i cant stop thinking about these dirty vids that were on his phone. 

i truly hate him. i want to leave him so badly but i cant because im financially dependant on him, i have to wait for a job and then find a place which might take a while. 

&#x200B;

ALSO I WANTED TO ASK.... IF HE THROWS THINGS IN ANGER ..

1) is this domestic abuse? 

and 

2)  WILL THIS TURN INTO HIM HITTING ME??? ..... because my dad the same, he throws things in anger but he doesnt hit my mum... hes been like this for 30+ years ...

7597,Should I feel guilty for cheating on my abusive boyfriend?,"i was in a long term emotionally and physically/sexually abusive relationship. he never hit me during an argument but he has raped me and would hit me and choke me during sex without my consent. and i felt very very trapped. and i had tried for so long to be the best i could for him. for years. but he would just get worse and worse and more dangerous. and he would say awful things to me when he was in a bad place. but then things would be amazing when he was in a better place. very up and down and it felt impossible for me to leave, he knew what to say to get me to stay. 

about a month before we finally broke up i slept with a close male friend. i didn’t plan on doing it but we were alone and it just happened. and it was really great. not just physically but emotionally. i knew that my sex life with my boyfriend was unhealthy but i didn’t realize how deep it went. this was my first time having sex with someone who (without me telling him to) asked me if i was okay with things and if it felt good. and when neither of us ended up finishing because we were both tired, he didn’t force himself on me or storm off. he just said it was totally fine and we both fell asleep.

i never told my bf that this happened but this was part of the final straw of me finally breaking up with him. to know that things could be different was so game changing. and not only do i not feel guilty but i’m really glad it happened. and i’m on great terms with my friend, we’re closer than ever. 

i think cheating is wrong and i don’t agree with lying to someone you care about. but at the same time i feel like maybe in some cases it’s sort of justified. but i don’t know is this something i should feel bad about?",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
7600,my boyfriend was arrested last night for DV and I'm so sad,"I legitimately thought I would die. It included strangulation and hard open handed hits to the face, and he also broke my phone and a door. Thankfully the police were called, and he had calmed down a bit by then so I was able to open the door. They saw the marks and after I said he physically assaulted me, they immediately cuffed him. This was all because I mocked an ex of his. He told me I was clearly talking about his exes with his friends and started strangling me on the floor. I didn't think he would stop and my consciousness was diminishing. I tried running and hiding in the bathroom but he kicked in the door and then broke my new, expensive phone in half before I could call 911. All with a sneer on his face I can never forget.

So why am I sad right now? He's horribly abusive. There's no world in which it's okay to do any of this. It doesn't matter what petty joke I make, at the most you disengage and leave. You don't abuse someone no matter what they say. But I keep imagining him in that holding cell, which is exactly the nightmare he's told me he's had for so long - being arrested and going to jail again - all alone and feel sad. Even though he brought this upon himself! I did not call the police myself, but I was relieved audibly when I saw them because I knew he would stop. But I'm still worried as hell for him and wonder how mad he is at me, how ashamed he feels, and wish I could hug and hold him again (which will probably never happen again).

7602,i can’t leave my boyfriend,My boyfriend and I started dating 5 months ago. When we started dating he was the sweetest and most patient person. His only defect was that he vaped a lot. He told me he had quit carts though and he was working to quit vaping next. He was athletic and loved to workout. He had a job and a car. Over time he started becoming possessive. He didn’t let me hang out with my friends and he had to accompany me everywhere. He started telling me that it was because he cared about me and wanted to hang out with me all the time. I didn’t like it but everything i spoke out he made me feel bad and told me that i didn’t love him. I ended up discovering that he still did carts and the way he treats me when he’s on them is not it. I have tried to leave him but everytime i do he threatens to hurt himself. i caught him talking to other girls and when i found out i decided to leave him. when i got home a couple hours later my phone was flooded from calls from his sister and mom telling me that if i loved him i would give him another chance . and the truth is that i do care about him and love him but i can’t be in that relationship anymore. i’ve tried telling him that we can be friends but he doesn’t take it well. he made me cut off all my friends. the only friends that i have right now are my 2 childhood friends. one of them is guy. he’s a lifelong friend and i can’t cut him off over something like this. today we got into an arguement about that. he waited outside my job so drunk and started spamming my phone with texts and calls. then he sent me pictures of him cutting himself. i need to leave but how can i do so safely and without hurting him?,irrelevant,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

I woke up to pain from it and I screamed and started crying. The louder and more I begged him to get off of me, he kept moaning louder as if to cover my cries. I’m physically hurting so bad from the force he used. But Im scared. He has never done this to me. I asked him why did he do that to me after I said stop.  He said “because he can”.. I have been with him 5 years and he’s never done this to me. During the assault he kept asking me if I was cheating on him. I was crying no. It was as if he was wanting me to comfort him.

7606,I think I need to get away from my boyfriend,"I don't want to say this. It's been making me feel sick, but I can't do this anymore. My boyfriend and I have been together for six years since I was 18 and he was 22. It was so different then and I'm only seeing it now.

We kind of have a BDSM dynamic, but it's never been my favorite thing. I participate in it because I love him, but he's been getting riskier with it and I feel like he's deliberately putting me in danger. Maybe I'm overreacting, but that's what I've been thinking. I don't like it when he ties me up or to something, but I don't say that. I told him a few days ago during a scene that I would appreciate it if he didn't have me tied up so tightly or for as long, but he got mad at me, yelled about something I don't even remember, and left me tied to the bed. I heard the front door slam and didn't hear him come back in until three hours later. He left me tied to the bed for three hours. I felt so worthless, which is probably what he wanted. I know I maybe could've been nicer or just stuck it out, but it all made me feel subhuman.

I think this might be my breaking point. I've put up with so much and I can't do it anymore. I'm all alone and I'm only just now realizing how badly I've fucked up by letting this happen. I let him sabotage my relationships with everyone I loved, I let him keep me in the house, and I still fucking love him. That's how stupid I am. I let myself get too afraid to even use my safe word because it pisses him off. I've done so many things that I didn't want to do because I didn't want to make it worse. It's all my fault. I'm not even sure what counts as abuse and what doesn't because of our dynamic. I don't know where the line is drawn. I've told him to stop hitting me during scenes before, but those were scenes. I don't know what's real and what's not and I'm so fucking confused.

I don't know if I need to leave or if I need to fix my attitude. I don't know what to do anymore. I wouldn't even have anywhere to go if I left.

7612,Boyfriend kicked me out of his car,"This is the most embarrassing thing ever. I feel traumatized. My boyfriend and I were at Starbucks and instead of going through the drive thru he wanted me to go inside even though I was in slippers and pajamas. I told him no, I don’t want to go in, why can’t we use the drive thru. Instead he ended up driving away and saying to me “now you get nothing cause you wouldn’t go in, you better not ask me to drive you anywhere later” and I tossed a box of donuts at him that were his. Tossed it on his lap while he was maybe going 5km through a parking lot, and I told him “yeah whatever”. The whole car ride he was poking at me and trying to piss me off, I wasn’t yelling and was pretty calm the whole time. Just tossed his donuts at him when he told me I’d have nothing.. 

After I did that he told me to get out. My dog was in the car, I did not want to be left stranded. We live on an island, I have no friends, no family, I didn’t have my wallet, my phone was dying and I also have asthma and didn’t have my inhaler to walk home. We live up a giant hill and it was easily a 40 minute walk home and I knew I could not walk up that giant hill without my inhaler. So I refused, I was panicking. I didn’t wanna leave my dog and didn’t wanna be stranded. He drove to a different parking lot and proceeded to push and pull me out of the car, punching my arm multiple times until he threw me out and drove away with my dog. He came back 5 minutes later while I was crying on the side walk and he decided to yell at me when he came back. He told me “nobody is coming to get you, nobody cares. Start walking” I know multiple people watched this happen and watched him practically beating on me and nobody said anything or called the authorities. 

I know I shouldn’t have tossed the donuts at him, and I realize that. I don’t think it was putting us in any danger. I wasn’t yelling or being “crazy” like I stated, I was actually pretty calm.

7617,I can’t stop giving my boyfriend money,"I’ve already given him $320 over the past few months. He keeps asking me for money and for some reason I give it to him.

UPDATE: 
For those of you wondering… 

I gave him $100 a month ago and he said he was going to pay me back. A month passed and he never paid me back so I got my dad involved. I also filed a small claims against him. My dad went to his house and my (now ex) bf didn’t come to the door instead his cousin answered and his cousin told my ex how my dad came and this pissed him off. He threatened to come to my house, had his sister text me threatening to beat me up, and we just fought over text messages for a day 1/2 (I can post the text messages if y’all want). After a week or so, I wanted him to forgive me for some reason and the only way he said was if I paid him $100 and I did that like the idiot I am. I drove to his house and we argued for awhile, he almost hit me, and I still gave him the $100 and then we drove around and he crashed my car and drove off. The next day, I gave him $120 for some reason?! I don’t even know why… He brought me back $120 of weed though which was nice I guess idek. I’m in literal shock at this point. He crashed my fucking car and drove off wtf is wrong with this dude. FYI he is on pills he said he was done with them though but who knows. We’re both 19, he turns 20 in like 20 days and I just turned 19. I don’t know what to do about the small claims. My mom says I won’t be able to win since I gave him more money what do you guys think?

7620,My Boyfriend downplays his hurtful behaviors and calls them “small accidents”. What do you think?,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for some time & I love him very much. However, he hurts me with his behaviors and then downplays them. He calls them little ""accidents"" or tells me that his behavior is normal & that my reaction is not. 

For example, the other day while cooking together, he stuffed a spoonful of extremely hot food into my mouth without any warning. The hot food burned my mouth. He stared at me with a blank expression on his face & seemed like he was enjoying it. That was just my gut instinct tho, idk if it’s right. Then he asked me what was wrong with me & told me this action was normal. 

Another time he wanted sex in the morning & I declined bc of his disrespectful attitude. Then he jumped out of bed, told me that he was going downstairs to the kitchen for breakfast & that I shouldn’t budge until he was back. I complied because he was mad & I was scared of him. When confronted later, he said he was so sleepy that he didn't even realize what came out of his mouth.

recently during oral sex, he held my head firmly & pushed my head up and down roughly. I hadn’t consented and this hadn’t been discussed before. Although I could barely breathe & was in tears, he ignored my discomfort. He called it just a “little bit of bdsm action”. 

What do you think? Are his explanations credible? Are these really just ""little accidents"" like he says or is this toxic? 

And before people write here why I am in a relationship with him: I love him very much & I am good-natured. Maybe I’m too understanding & very socially isolated since I've been with him. I'm afraid of starting over.

Btw I’ve told him that his behaviors hurt me but he never acknowledges that he did something wrong. He’s always right.

7622,"Am I (30f) the problem, or is it my boyfriend (35m)?","My boyfriend (35m) and I (30f) got into a fight a few days ago. He said he really wanted to have a talk with me and sat me down. Immediately his tone made this feel more like complaints, and not trying to actually have a mutual conversation. He started naming off so many things wrong with me, and then he would continue onto the next thing. He wouldn’t let me say many comments or try to explain myself. Some things he said was like “you don’t have a career in mind”, “You don’t live in reality, you live beyond your means”, “You don’t clean, you don’t do anything.”, “You don’t take care of James” (my 2 year old son), “You’re always tired”, “You only talk about Alex” (my ex who I’m going through a court case currently), “You and your friend spy on his girlfriend”, “I had to beg/convince you to switch James to the big bed”, “What are you doing for James’s potty training?”, “Are you going to clean if we lived together, because you never clean”, and then he’s like “how can you go to work in the morning knowing you have dishes in the sink? Why don’t you clean more?” 

I started crying because I said you don’t know what it’s like when you’re doing all of this by yourself, he got offended and said “when are you doing this by yourself? It’s no excuse, if James is not in daycare I’m here, you’re something else” and he kind of laughed at me. 
 
Meanwhile, I’m crying trying to explain that’s not what I meant, I pay for everything myself and have all responsibilities falling on me so it’s stressful and I’m trying my best as a single mom. I felt broken and sad and he said I was making this about myself. I had no idea he felt this way about me. He wouldn’t let me talk, he wouldn’t listen to anything I said, and he didn’t offer any solutions to his complaints. He was only listing things off one after another. 

I don’t know if he’s right, maybe I’m dramatic and defensive, but I felt attacked and really put down when I feel like I’m genuinely trying my best and the things he was saying weren’t even true, and largely exaggerated. I need help gaining clarity on this because I just don’t understand.

7624,boyfriend offered to loan money,"Weird question. When I was with my boyfriend, within the first month, he offered to loan me money with nothing in return. I paid him off. Again something came up, this time more, he offered again without me asking. Paid it off. Again, he offered this time, the amount was higher...a few thousand he offered. I asked him why...he said it would help us both. I didn't see how. He wasn't getting anything out of it. Even when I was on the brink of leaving, he offered to loan me a few thousand for something. With nothing in return. No interest. He repeatedly throughout our relationship asked me if I needed money cause he knew I would pay him back.

Yet we'd go out to subway or such and I would offer to pay, get my card ready...and he would literally jump in and say..I got it...At home, he would guilt trip me...I ALWAYS PAY for dinner. What?

Even though I was paying for pizza, olive garden applebees, mc d's like 2 x a week. Anytime he paid and he offered, he would guilt trip me.

Keep in mind, he would never ever buy things for me. He would celecbreate Christmas and birthdays. But nothing sentimental. On our second anniversary, he gave me a note saying happy anniversary. He didn't even do anything special like make dinner or date night. Nothing. I would have been happy even if he did dishes that night or watched a movie and cuddled. But he was cold and distant. I didn't do anything bad. I made dinner, dressed nice that night and didn't argue nothing to cause any problems.

7625,I am thinking about leaving my boyfriend in this second UPDATE,"UPDATE AND A HUGE THANK YOU TO YOU ALL!!!!

Old post: https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/s/KSFgradTMH

Hey people,

I can't thank you enough for yesterday. Every single comment has helped me so much. Gave me courage. You probably really saved my life. I can't thank you enough. I wish I could reply to everyone, but I'm very unstable at the moment but wanted to give an update and still thank you all. 

I made an appointment with my psychiatrist last night straight after this post. I went today. Sat in the waiting room and thought it's now or never. My thought process was that I could get help there directly. I blocked and deleted everything. I collapsed in the waiting room. With a full-blown panic attack and a pulse over 180 with falling over. Which is embarrassing enough for me. After calming down a bit and coming back to myself again, I had an appointment with my psychiatrist and she really took her time, even though she didn't have any. She personally made sure that I got help straight away and referred me to a clinic and even phoned the clinic and explained everything. I am currently packing my things with the help of my brother and will go to the clinic. I am so weak and can hardly walk. So many flashbacks have come back that my whole body hurts. But it was exactly these comments that encouraged me to really go to the clinic and get help. I am sorry, if this sounds like i am over exaggerating. I am just not that strong atmo and probably i will look back one day and will laugh about this weak behavior and how silly i acted. 

Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You are unbelievably great.",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
7626,My abusive boyfriend has “changed” but I feel checked out.,"My abusive boyfriend was so awful to me during pregnancy, I stayed praying that he would change, he would drink and hit me sometimes and yell and call me every name in the book. He’s a textbook loser too no job blew my savings on gambling without my permission. The entire pregnancy was awful. I really didn’t have much going for me, but did land a good job. So I started making good money and of course supported him. Abuse continued. He wished death on me multiple times and told me that he wished I would die after the baby was born. 

Fast forward
I’m giving birth and I nearly die. Go figure.
I developed and infection during labor, went sepsis, DIC, and started hemorrhaging, had a torn artery as well, lost almost all the blood in my body. I was in icu with blood transfusions for 3 days til they would complete the surgery. During that time the doctors advised him that the baby was ok but that I may not make it. 


Fast forward again
I made it. Lol after 3 procedures 12 units of blood transfusions, and 2 weeks of hospital food I make it to care for my baby. And my boyfriend is a changed man. Seemingly anyway. It’s been almost 3 months I’m nearly fully recovered and he loves me like never before. He’s going to start work soon and has been so cautious with me. He waits on me and my baby. He tries to kiss me constantly and completely quit drinking. Those 2 weeks must have really done something.



Problem is now that I feel checked out.
I don’t feel I love him. I feel like I really don’t like him. Idk I feel numb to his kindness. The abuser has changed, I got my wish. Even if it is temporary but I’m not happy. I woke up from all that wanting to leave but I needed help with the baby after all my surgeries.
 I don’t feel sympathetic for him anymore. I just feel nothing for him. So I’ll be leaving now that I can walk and care for myself and my child. I’m glad he’s different for the baby’s sake. But anyway I just wanted t let the community know that even when abusers do change, the damage is so far deep, you don’t love them in the end anyway",yes,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred

7633,"Can't get an abortion, abusive boyfriend and no money... what do I do?","


Hello, I'm 19F and in a really bad situation. Throwaway as a few people I know IRL follow my account. 

I'm in a relationship with 35M. I rely on him entirely financially as he controls my main account as he doesn't trust me with money. All I have is £5 in a PayPal account. We met when I was 16 (age of consent in UK) and he has isolated me from all real friends and family. I honestly have no idea how I ended up here, he was very nice at the time and made me feel loved and seen but the moment I moved in with him he began to get meaner and meaner. I really want to get away, but the situation is complicated because I refuse to leave my dog and now I've recently found out I'm pregnant despite us using birth control (I'm on the pill, he refuses to use a condom)

If he finds out I had an abortion (he keeps track of where I go throughout the day) I'm scared about what he will do. I need a way to get some money quickly so I can get away and maybe stay in a hotel room and begin from there, I also need money to get a new passport because without it I won't be able to find new work. But I'm not sure how to do this or to go about this. I'm scared if I contact charities they won't care about my dog enough or he will find out. I don't know what to do and I feel so sick I'm anxious 

Please advise. I feel anxious as hell having no funds or safety net and the thought of relying on a shelter to cover all my needs with no back up is terrifying. What do I do? Are there any ways I can earn even £50 online so I can get a hotel room somewhere and have the abortion before going ahead?

7638,I am still missing my abusive ex boyfriend,"I (F22) kicked my abusive ex boyfriend (M 24) out at the beginning of the year. He wasn’t always horrible, but towards the end of our three year relationship he had grabbed me by the throat, shoved me violently countless times, pulled my hair, spit in my face, etc etc. as well as calling me countless names and throwing insults that no one should ever say. All of these things were always in response to my actions, sometimes extremely minimal, which he would say pushed him to loose control. He fell behind on bills and rent and continued to be abusive to me while I took care of those finances. I am not the type of person who resorts to verbal or physical abuse but I found myself fighting back similarly in that last year, and I feel ashamed. 

After he moved out, he came crawling back weeks later claiming to have had some epiphany and that he would do all the work necessary to change for me. Even though he moved hours away, he would visit me all the time and started acting very nice and loving out of nowhere. We still argued, but he wasn’t violent or hateful. 

I still broke it off again after a few months because something in my gut told me it wasn’t right. I’m at a pretty lonely point in my life right now and have found myself missing him a lot. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, or why I only remember the good when I know he’s done such horrible things to me. He was definitely doing much better but I have heard from others that this is a part of the cycle of abuse.

7639,my boyfriend wants me to take accountability for my depression upsetting him.,"I had a mental breakdown last night, its the fourth I've had this month, i know i'm ill and i do need help. This time there was a suicide attempt, if i had known it would have caused a backlash today.. i wish i hadn't been around to endure it. I've just had to sit through him telling me how badly that traumatized him last night, and yes you could easily see that as reasonable right? I do, that was never a doubt that it caused him trauma. but not for a moment has he understood or shown me any sympathy, if anything the reason it got to that point was because the more i broke last night the more he appeared frustrated and annoyed with me, until i had nothing left. He is wanting me to accountability for how it made him feel, is that right? and should i apologize? I'm so confused. I really tried to understand why he was making my mental breakdown about him and he just got more angry with me for trying to understand. When i already knew it was traumatic. It's like I am condemned for being severely depressed. When i just want him to accept and hold me. I'm really confused right now, if I'm wrong I'll make it right.

7642,Did my ex boyfriend commit SA during our intercourses?,"TW: sexual assault, possible r*pe, reproductive abuse

I was with him for a year. The first few times we had sex, he always used condoms. Then we ran out of it so I told him to pull out (it was stupid of me to let this happened in the first place). 

Ever since then, that was our go to way to end our intercourses. I have told him multiple times that I am really scared of getting pregnant by using this method. 

His answer is always that due to a condition he has, he doesn't feel comfortable using condoms and would go flat whenever he uses them. 

Strange that at least 4 times when we did, he didn't have any troubles staying erected and would last until the end. 

He always expressed his frustrations due to me not being on the pill, I can’t be on them as I’m a bigger girl and my weight would interfere with the pill's effectiveness to work. 

I have expressed my concerns and put an ultimatum on him about this use but he never truly respected it. 

I also spoke to his ex girlfriend before me and she also ended up getting on the pill again out of fear as he cornered her into doing that. 

As now I’m reflecting on our break up, I feel so assaulted and violated. 

Anyone have similar experiences?

7644,My ex-boyfriend gaslight me so I recorded his abuse,"I (F29) dated my ex M(26) for 2 years. He was seemingly an excited and over hyper guy who loved all the things I loved, so we clicked easily from the start. However after spending Time with him, I noticed within a few months that something was wrong and he had severe red flags (although I chose to ignore them). 

I tried to make it work and he promised he would start therapy to get help, which never happened and the relationship broke down further to the point in which he was abusing me severely. I lost my job and became homeless and as he took me into his family home, I had no say in the relationship again and had to endure it longer than I wanted to, for fear of being on the streets.

I started recording his abusive episodes secretly and have now decided to release them as I am now safe and in a location where he cannot find me.

I successfully took out a restraining order out in December 2022 and in response, he took out one in January 2023, claiming I am his abuser. I am unsure how he believes himself when he said this, due to the severity of the abuse inflicted onto me by him.

I am in hiding due to Trinidad and Tobago being a corrupted country, in which it is easy to assassinate persons without getting caught. Due to the false pretense in which he attained his restraining order, we go to family court next month (May 12 2023) to have it contested, and more episodes will continue to be posted to the YouTube account until it becomes viral in my country.

I met this man 8 years ago. We had a long distance relationship. I’m from New York he’s in Florida. I moved down 2 years ago after flying back and forth for years. When I moved here everything was good til I didn’t listen to him I guess. If he got mad he would use leverage over things. Remind you when I moved here I was waiting for my car and other belongings to get shipped. When he would get mad and I needed a ride to work he would tell me Uber. When he got mad he would kick me out knowing I have no where to go. I try to hang with my friends that I met here who are all females he wants to come too if he can’t ima here about it for days. How I’m neglecting him. Every time he’s mad he makes me go through these hurdles to do what I need to do. I’ve always been a working women and this has gone so far that I haven’t worked in 2 months because I feel myself getting weak. I don’t feel the same. He tells his family I’m the problem especially when I have proof he is. I moved my kid here and instead of forming a bond with him he just makes him clean and do stuff. This was not what I expected at all. I was so successful and now I just feel like nothing.

7651,I had my coworker call the cops on my boyfriend.,"This morning I’m regretting it because this has caused a much bigger problem for me personally but I have reached my limit. He had taken my phone from me which I’ve experienced before with another abusive partner. I tried using Siri and Alexa to no avail. I warned him. He could’ve left the room, gone for a walk, anything to try and calm down. He chose not to. I had to use my Instagram account on my laptop to ask my coworker to call the cops. 4-5 Cops show up and he’s out of there. My friend suggested I reach out to my bfs parents. I have never been connected with them so I spent the evening DMing his mom on Instagram of all places. They want me to drop charges and they’re telling me they’ll help me get out of our lease, but I just feel like they’re enabling him. He and I were together for almost 5 years. It’s been up and down. He doesn’t leave. He thinks he’s helping me by forcing us to live out our leave as if nothing has changed. Making me sleep in the same bed as him (he refuses to sleep on the couch even when I suggested we could trade off every other day). My dog is in love with him. I know he means well but I’ve been living a lie and walking on eggshells for too long. I just want him to realize how bad it’s gotten and what he’s actually done by prolonging this. It’s all financially motivated it seems. “Doesn’t want to break a lease. Too expensive etc etc” 
He was my best friend, but ultimately he chose this path. I gave him many opportunities to work on the relationship, he chose not to work on it. And still here I am calling his work and letting them know he’s not gonna be making it in for reasons “I’m not at liberty to say” I’m struggling mentally, financially, and my career is in tatters… yet I’m finding ways to save the situation. I am gutted. I just can’t believe this. He tells me he loves me but I don’t think he knows what love really is.

7659,"My boyfriend punched me in the face, I need some advice","I apologize beforehand for how long this might be but my boyfriend punched me in the face last night while we arguing and I’m so lost on what to do next. 
Me (22f) and my boyfriend (22m) we’re having an argument last night, which was started mostly on my part honestly, the content of the argument wasn’t important but it stemmed from my lack of trust in him. We’ve been dating for about 6 months and I recently found out he did some questionable things at the begging of our relationship. After confronting him about it we agreed to try to continue the relationship but I have been struggling with my trust in him because the whole situation was confusing to me and the fact that he lied so easily to me about it when I knew what he was doing has been giving me anxiety, I have told him that though and that it was gonna take me a while to trust him again, even though I want to. 
So I got upset about it again with him last night, and when I told him I don’t trust him and that I think he’s capable of doing worse (like cheating on me) he got very heated and punched me right in my cheek. I now have a swollen, bruised and very sore cheek. After he realized what he did he immediately felt bad and started crying and apologizing, which then made me feel worse because I know I kind of antagonized him to that point. 
I still love him very much, but I don’t know how to move forward. 
This isn’t the first time he hit me. either, so I’m very confused, he has chocked me during arguments when I try to leave the room, and when I found out about what he did and then tried to break up with him he punched my leg and my arm very hard to where it left bruising and held me down so I couldn’t leave. It’s just that each time he has done something like this he has expressed remorse immediately and promised to not do it again. He says he just blacks out and loses control. I know he’s not a bad person, and besides the physical violence and him breaking my trust one time, he’s been good to me. I’m also scared if I leave him, he’s gonna hurt himself. We also recently moved in together so that complicates things a little. I’m just so confused on what I should do next and just wanted to see if anybody has been in a similar situation and can offer some advice.",cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
7667,My boyfriend flipped out at me for catching a flu,"I'm back.

I of course caved to another round of his apologies, but his nice streak came to a screeching halt yesterday morning. 

He caught a flu earlier in the week and I picked it up Friday afternoon, after he was already recovering. I had a fever, still have an awful cough, body aches, etc. I get tested for covid weekly for work so I know it's not that. I seem to be down a little bit longer than he was. 

Yesterday morning I was so sick. (Keep in mind he doesn't drive, I have to take him everywhere, I take him to work and pick him up; I'm available to him at all times-- but I have STRONGLY encouraged him to get his license.) He had a complete tantrum and meltdown; he yelled at me, called me a c**t, b**ch, because it has been a beautiful weekend and now it's all spent and wasted, and he never gets what he wants, and I (me) don't ever want to do anything, he wants to kill me, he wants to kill himself, he's going to leave and go to some other woman's house and call me when he gets there. I didn't respond, I had no energy. I begged and pleaded with him to just please leave; he wouldn't. 

I passed out from exhaustion for about an hour when I woke up he was there, waiting. I knew if I wanted any peace I better get up and take him out for the day. I took him out from about 1:30 to 9, came home and passed out. This morning we woke up and he made sure I knew what the day would be like if I didn't comply; I  STILL feel awful and right now I'm sitting at a park while he happily fishes and I'm wondering how I'm going to function tomorrow for work, because I got no rest this weekend, and was verbally and mentally destroyed for two days straight.

Has anyone else had their partner be abusive to them purely because they were sick? I don't know what more of myself I can give him. This is awful but I keep having this thought that I wish I could be just a little sicker so I could go to the hospital and have rest without being yelled at or made to keep moving.",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred
7668,Black eye/boyfriend arrested/sad gal,"
Hi all. I don’t usually post, but I’m spiraling a bit and just need some feedback. 

My boyfriend got arrested this weekend for domestic violence. Long story short - he was very intoxicated and blacked my eye. I didn’t know what else to do but call 911. I could tell it was only going to get worse. This isn’t the first time this has happened. 

We haven’t spoken since. I pass by his house on my way to work and notice his vehicle hasn’t moved.. and I’m strangely worried about him still being in jail? 

(He’s most likely not. We live in Mississippi and a lot of the cops are “good ol boys” that he’s friends with.)

I didn’t press charges or anything.. I don’t even know how to go about that or if I should. I still love him but I’m very much on the fence of being worried about him/being sad it happened/being sad we haven’t talked and then looking at my face/broken things and getting pissed.

1. Is he going to be punished?
2. Should I feel bad in any way for calling 911?
3. What would you do in my situation? (Willing to provide more context if needed)

7669,Drunk Boyfriend Put Hands on Me - PLEASE READ,"Hi everyone. I’ve been in this relationship for    over a year. The other night my boyfriend and I were walking home from the bar with his friends and he was telling his friends a story and a part of it wasn’t true, so I called him out on it. He then said you were too far away so you didn’t hear that part. I most certainly did. After we got back to our apartment that we share, we got in an argument about the situation. I then went to bed while he stayed up and drank 4 old fashions and played video games. Later that  night he came to bed. I made a comment about the dog we have because it woke me up and I said “Shhhh.” So then we started to argue again and he’s belligerent at this point. He then twisted my nose and back. After that, I said “You are just mad because I’m the only one who tells you when you are right or wrong.” He then got on top of me in bed and put his hands around my neck. It wasn’t hard at all but still it is not okay. His dad is a recovering alcoholic (27 years sober). The next day I told his mother the situation and she said she sees the same tendencies my boyfriend has that her husband had when he was drinking (my boyfriends dad). We are currently in a lease together, but we haven’t seen each other since the incident. He plans on going to therapy and to stop drinking but I don’t know what to do.

He was drunk, fighting with his friend. She tried to stop him and he turned on her. He hit her in the head. Blood everywhere. She kicked him out, called the cops. He's arrested. Her son and his daughter were there. He's in jail. She's filing a restraining order after Christmas. His daughter is still there. My daughter is fine with that. I think we should send the daughter to her grandma. I feel like that's the safest option for both the child and my daughter. My daughter kicked him out so he's jobless and homeless.

I'm willing to pay for the plane ticket to get her there. My greatest concern is safety. I live 5 hours from there. Also, there are weapons in the house. My daughter has a .38 special.

Ever since this happened, i had him blocked for a few days. His aunt contacted me to tell me they are supporting him and took away his gun. about 3 days go by and  a mutual friend of him and i repeatably asks me to unblock him because he has a lot to say to me. I was feeling extra vulnerable in that moment so i agreed.. He kept apologizing and told me hes starting to go to therapy and he wants to work on his anger issues , compulsiveness, mental issues, because he says in the end game he wants to spend his life with me. He told me he loves me and he can't picture a life without me. I felt so conflicted about what to do. We talked for awhile and ultimately decided we can keep in touch day by day and i'll see how i feel but we are NOT back together. I still haven't seen him since.

So now we are casually texting during the day (not all day) . He is always apologizing for what he did and tells me hes not that person but nonetheless he wants to work on it. I honestly do not feel ready to never see him again and cut off all contact.. it is really hard now and im scared that if i go back im going to be stuck in a toxic relationship.

7678,"Boyfriend suspects I'm leaving, is suddenly nice...","Over the past several years, I have been experiencing, what I didn't realize, could be considered abuse.

I didn't think anything of it, because he showered me with affection. Flash forward seven years....we buy a house together. We have two kids together. 
    I have no friends. I have limited contact with my family because he tells me they are horrible people, and they don't support ""our"" family as a unit.  He has somehow got me to stop working for the past five years that we have owned the house together. I have no say in finical matters, he has maxed out my credit card. I have tried to start working since the second child because it makes.me.feel better..since I've been doing so, he wants a joint bank account, and to be able to dish out a stipend.  And since he can no longer claim me as a dependent, he wants us to get married so we can file jointly. And that if I don't, I don't support the family as a unit. That I'm being selfish and selfseving for wanting to handle my own end. That he says, that's a deal breaker for him.
   Since the second child, I've had my eyes opened. One particular instance, where I had her in my arms, he waved a fist at.me, like he was going to hit me. Since that, I've noticed more and more, and feel like I've been snapping back to reality ( and myself) and coming out of a dream like state. 
    He has seemingly gained control over.my whole life..wanting access to all of my photos on google claiming it's because he can see the kids. 
     Hesitant to leave because of the kids. Of I'm not around to protect them, what if he gets shared custody. That honestly scares me more than staying. He has Misophonia and will refuse to care for the kids if they are  crunching on something.

7681,Part 1: Boyfriend with Gun vs Cops with Guns,"It's been over a year now that I have been mentally, emotionally, and spiritually drained because of the constant fighting with my boyfriend. The relationship has been the hardest to deal with over the past couple of weeks now and I am trying my hardest to convince myself that I can't stay with him anymore because he is literally killing me. I haven't had any sleep, I'm exhausted all the time, I'm stressed beyond belief, and I feel I will die of a heart attack very soon if I don't get out. 

Two days ago, late at night, my boyfriend was concerned about his friend because she was feeling blue and he wanted me to check up on her. I completely refused because I was already emotionally drained and falling into a depression that I couldn't handle anyone else's issues at the moment. I needed some time to breathe. I ended up trying to acknowledge his request by telling him that I would call her tomorrow when I feel I've gained my energy back. Unfortunately, he didn't take this lightly. 

Because I refused to give her a call, we ended up getting into a verbal argument which lead to taking his gun to his car and threatening to shoot himself....because I wouldn't call his friend. I tried sitting with him for a bit and all he did was yell from the top of his lungs blurting out words of hatred. He called me selfish for not ensuring her well-being by just simply giving her a call. Meanwhile I had to ignore my own well-being. 

I stepped out of the car and came back. He still was sitting on the driver's seat with his gun on his lap. I asked him are you still planning on shooting yourself and he said only if you don't call my friend. 

I wasn't going to allow him to take that much control over me. 

I told him that I had no other choice but to get the cops involved. At this point I thought he would change his mind but instead he decided remain stubborn and say ""by the time the cops come, my brains will be scattered all over the car""

7683,Abusive long term boyfriend,"Ive posted this before on another sub, but figured I might get more advice here on how to get out of this. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 11 years, and the last 2 years have been absolute hell. He started off just controlling; something that should have been my warning sign. Then it turned into emotional abuse and now, physical abuse. Everyday I hear that I’m a stupid, dumb b**** who is worthless. I have been trying SO hard to keep up with his standards, but it seems like every morning it starts again. I’ve been waking up with him early (4:30)  and start working nonstop, but then I hear about how much I’m not doing. 

I remember when the physical abuse started. He pushed me so hard I fell. Then he started slapping me, pinching me, kicking me, punching me. I don’t remember the last time I was bruise free. It has been daily, even though it’s just been slapping the past week (I know, it’s not just slapping.... compared to everything else I have endured, this is nothing). My hair is so thin because he’s pulled it all out. I’m literally on the verge of just wanting to die constantly. My family is hundreds of miles away, and no matter how many times I have tried to end it.. there’s always an excuse. Not on my end, but his. I have absolutely no resources to fall back on because everyone I know is so far away. 

I’m constantly fearing going home after every work day, and have incredible anxiety (which I am forced to hide due to fear of being hurt) every weekend. Part of the issue is not doing enough with him (going out, hiking, fun activities) but I am so afraid of getting hurt and making him angry  that I don’t want to do anything with him anymore.

7685,Abusive boyfriend arrested. Feeling a lot of emotions,"I feel a mix of emotions. It's been years of torment as we lived together and he has said he couldn't afford to move out (has had issues holding down a steady job throughout the years). I've kicked him out 2x before  but he ended up coming back. He never hit me but has been verbally and emotionally abusive over the years-telling me things like 'don't get me angry or I'll blow up' over the smallest things, and calling me every name in the book. He's destroyed many of my household items or he's threatened to if I don't do something he's asked right that minute. I already have issues with anxiety and he just raises it through the roof at times. I jump at loud noises because I now equate it with him blowing up and getting ready to damage something of mine. For a while I had issues with I think it's called dissociative disorder. I would look in the mirror or look at my hands and not feel like they were mine. He's even told me I should commit suicide and told me a way to do it (I am not suicidal and would never do that).

 I finally went on a domestic abuse website for help and spent 2hrs on a chat. The person sent me resources I could look over and and they helped me devise a plan to start the motions of getting him out of my apartment. Unfortunately, not even 1/2 hr later I had to text 911 for help as he threatened me, pulled a knife from the kitchen and started stabbing the couch, and then told me to keep quiet. 

He's been arrested and held. I feel relief, sadness, shock, and guilt. He definitely has some mental issues that he refused to get help with (refused to see any doctors, wouldn't go for annual check up, wouldn't even sign up for health insurance) I'm afraid of the whole process going forward and what will come next (which is why it took me so long to call, and why his sister likely never called). I'm sad that it had to come to this and wish we could've just peacefully separated. He's said off and on throughout our relationship that he wanted to leave, and then would eventually just terrorize me.

 I feel guilt because he doesn't have the means to rent and I'm not sure where he will end up. I know this is his fault and that it's not something I should worry about, but it's something the weighs on me now.

I also feel relief because I finally told my parents what's been going on. They don't live in the area but they offered to drive up to make sure I was ok (we had plans set for mid-june and that was when I was hoping to work on his moving out process).",cannot be inferred,yes,yes,no,cannot be inferred,,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,yes
7688,I had my boyfriend arrested hours ago. I feel so guilty.,"My (25f) boyfriend (25m) went out to drink with his friends last night. He said he would be home by 1 or 2 AM so that we could pack for our weekend getaway. His friend had to order an Uber for him because he was incredibly drunk. He got in the Uber at 4:30 AM and by 5 AM his location on his phone said he was in the neighborhood. After 15 minutes of his location saying he was standing near the mailboxes around the corner, I walked outside to see if I could find him. Around the corner were two police vehicles with their lights on, and two officers talking to my boyfriend who was sitting on the curb. Apparently he went to a neighbor’s house thinking it was ours and was banging on the door and trying to get in, so they called the police. He was yelling and arguing with both me and the officers as we tried to speak with him. The officer offered to take him to the drunk tank and I said I could just take him home and let him sleep it off. They also mentioned that he lost his phone and that they would look for it outside and let me know if they find it. We get home and I try to tell him to go to bed and he starts yelling and swearing at me. He tried to go back outside to look for his phone and I stepped in front of the door to prevent this, since I didn’t want him to bother the neighbors again. He started yelling obscenities at me, calling me dumb, etc, got in my face while yelling at me and told me to get out. I stepped out the front door and he slammed it immediately. I had begun talking to the 911 operator as he was kicking me out. Periodically as I was speaking to the operator, he would open the door, yell hurtful things at me, and then slam the door again. The officers returned and took him in, and said he could be in there as late as Tuesday because of the holiday weekend. I can’t help but feel guilty for calling the police and having him arrested.

7693,Abusive Ex is making threats to beat up my new boyfriend,"So, my ex has an open court case and pending trial for attacking and trying to kill me. He recently called an old mutual friend and asked them if I can grant him permission to see his kids even if it's supervised visits (there is currently a restraining order on him for 1 year). In the same breathe, he threatened my new boyfriend and said that he is still going to beat him up if he sees him. 

I'm so frustrated because I just want to live my life and I don't want him sabotaging my relationships and making my life more difficult than it has to be. I currently have No Contact with my abuser, and plan on keeping it that way forever if I had my way. I don't want him to see our kids because he just isn't stable mentally to do so and will probably use them to get to me. My kids don't even want to see him out of fear that he will hurt me. I guess hearing that he is making threats and requesting to see the kids has brought back my fears and anxiety that I've worked so hard to get over. 

I want to believe that I have nothing to worry about.. keep living my life, and move on happily but I feel like he is a dark cloud that will never go away.

He always said the break up was complicated and that I would never understand the amount of guilt he felt and why he still had feelings for her, now I understand. He told me they got into a fight over me after a party Saturday night and he went crazy on her while he was drunk for taking my number from his phone. After a five hour conversation he admitted to me that he has cheated on every girlfriend he has been with and has only gotten physical with his ex but this isn't the first time he has touched her. He said he wants to change and be a better man for her and needs to fix himself for her because she deserves it. She has forgiven him and has agreed to give it another chance as long as he lets me go (zero contact). He told me that his lying and cheating already destroyed her and he doesn't want me to get hurt too and that he wants to go no contact. I don't know how to feel at this point. I honestly feel like a pawn in his twisted little game. His honesty might be saving me so much heart ache in the future but why on earth do I feel rejected and played right now?

7709,My (30) boyfriend (44) has been verbally abusive and in my face. Is this going to escalate and get physical? I'm scared and I feel frozen.,"TL;DR on the bottom.

Please forgive the wonky formatting, I'm writing this in the bathroom on my phone with shakey hands.  

This morning at 4:30 my boyfriend began yelling at me right in my face. He is a big guy and it was really loud. Telling me all the different ways in which I am not enough. He goes into work at 6:00 am and I get up with him and make his breakfast and pack him a lunch. I'm an early riser and I love preparing food for him (at least I used to). He used to be super gracious and praise me on his fabulous homemade packed lunches and creative breakfasts. He told me about how all the guys at work were jealous of his lunch It made me feel good. 

But not this morning. Today at 4:45 he told me ""Frittata again? And what are you packing me for lunch? Remember I work overtime. Did you know when I open my lunch bag I've been disappointed as many times as I've been delighted? I give so much more than I get from you!"" 

I said that wasn't cool of him to say and that I don't have to do this for him, I choose to and that's when he completely went off the rails on numerous tangents about many things are wrong with me - at full screaming volume right in my face. 

This is not the first time he has done this. He rarely apologizes. It feels like more and more he's testing the waters to see what else I'll take. He always ""love bombs"" me after a while, praising me and all that I do with the vernacular of a poet, and I forget these moments when he sprays me with venom.

I can't move out and I can't kick him out, he and his daughter (8) live in my apartment and don't have resources to move. His daughter calls me mommy (her bio mom is absentee) I've got two young daughters that I have shared custody of. This is my weekend with them but after this morning I feel like this could possibly escalate further and I don't know if my kids should be around? I'm scared and feel so powerless. He really made me feel so worthless today. I feel physically weak from it. 


TL;DR:

After screaming in my face at 4:30 am about how the breakfasts and lunches I prepare for him are not good enough I am scared that this pattern indicates that he will eventually get physical. It's my apartment, I can't move.

I have a place to go stay, at my moms house in a different state. My flight isn’t for another week. Right now my plan is to clean my house a bit and organize my things, so my family and I can drive back with a Uhaul in April to get the rest of my belongings (if he doesn’t destroy them all by then). I’m afraid of what will happen between now and when I fly home in a week.

I’m looking for support so I don’t cave. We have broken up a million times, and I always cave. We’re entirely dependent on one another and it’s just easier.

Fast forward to now, I feel like I’m being eaten. I wish I called the police that night, but I was afraid he would hit me again. I wish I had evidence so I could take him to court and so he could feel some punishment for what he did. I didn’t do anything wrong and I was never hit in my life. Why can’t I move past this?

7715,Boyfriend screams - but says it’s my fault? (X-post),"My boyfriend has a terrible temper that ends with him screaming.

We had an incident when he raised a belt buckle as a joke to hit me. I yanked it out of his hands and hose finger was caught. He SCREAMED at the top of my lungs for me to get the eff away from him, that I needed to get the eff at out the apartment. He stormed out to grab food and I packed my things and left.

This is the second bad screaming incident that we have had, and in the earlier incident I also left the situation quietly and didn’t communicate for a few hours.

When we talked again, he said:
You left without a note. You should have waited for me to get back.
This is why our relationship can’t progress, because you threaten to leave me (only when he has a temper tantrum).
When I said get out I just meant go around the block.
If you felt scared you should just break up with me, then. You shouldn’t be in a relationship like that.

He made no effort to try and change his behaviour... He has temper tantrums, or tries to push my buttons by saying “you can’t be pregnant, you have to abort it. I would give you money to go away.” (He has Ed so we don’t use condoms)

“I’m moving to New York to concentrate on work. You can’t be jealous of me going out to make friends. I’m going to leave with a single girl friend or mine.”

“I’m not getting a dog friendly apartment (I have a small dog) so don’t even push that on me.”

He had an incident where he tried to take another girl home with him and texted her all night. We broke up, and since then he has repeatedly said “remember when you dumped me” and it’s constantly my fault.

Obviously he has a lot of other great traits. He is 10 years senior and quite wealthy. Am I being manipulated?

My ex and I had been dating 2.5 years (our anniversary would've been this week). We had a normal relationship and was kind and caring boyfriend. He was never controlling or didn't want me to go out with my friends. Essentially he had no signs that he would be an abusive boyfriend. A few weeks ago we were at my friend party and he got really drunk. Although he has been this drunk before we had, had a fight before the party. The fight was one of our little fights I could count maybe 10 we've had in our relationship. Anyway, so he blew up at the party and when I came home an hour later he started beating me and choking me out of nowhere. The assault lasted a total of 40 minutes which also included kicking my head. I was just wondering if anyone else has had this happen just out of nowhere? There relationship be totally normal and then bam he beats the hell out of you. I'm still in shock and it sucks because I really loved him. I'm so confused what to do. Thanks for anyones input!

7724,Boyfriend has now begun wishing death upon me with his daily insults,"Boyfriend told me he hopes I die (and various other insults)

I have been with my boyfriend for a little over 3 years. He has shown his anger before, but it’s getting worse. On top of this, we have an apartment together so there is never really a way to escape him.
Last month, someone close to me died. Since then, he’s made no effort to comfort me or ask how I’m feeling after all of this. However, he has adapted death into his insults to me. (He already verbally abused me prior to this, I won’t even attempt to deny it.) 
About two weeks ago, he asked me to drive him to his brothers hockey game. I wasn’t really feeling great, after recently recovering from kidney stones so I told him I thought I would just shop in the local target right by the hockey rink. We called me various insults but the one that stung the most was “I hope you die. I hope you crash your car on the way home and die,” It was vile and just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse, it did.
He has now incorporated wishing death on me in his daily insults. I feel trapped because our apartment lease doesn’t expire until April and I can’t afford the entirety of the rent on my own monthly. However, I have been saving more money so that as soon as possible I can move into a place on my own and be free of it.
Today he told me to “drop dead”, last week he told me that I deserve to die. Is he truly that vile that he would begin wishing death upon me as I am going through the grief of losing someone I cared about?
I feel lost, defeated, alone. I’m ashamed to tell my family and friends about this because I don’t want to embarrass him. I won’t bother telling his parents because I’ve gone to them in the past about his verbal abuse and they did nothing. 
I just want to know how to block it out, so I can survive the last few months of my lease and save up enough to get my own place when the lease expires.

7726,My boyfriend has to stay 100 yards away from me.,"So, I have no idea where I'm going with this. I don't really understand how it got to this point, and I'm having a hard time grasping what I want the outcome to be. 

Last Wednesday, my boyfriend and I had a perfectly normal day, with - and this is important - no alcohol, no drugs, nothing. It was fine. I went to sleep and woke up to him trying to have sex with me, which I'm generally fine with, but this time I was too tired. I said ""no"", I said ""stop"", I said ""please don't do this."" 

And he did stop, but then ordered me out of his bed. We live together, so I said no and then rolled over to go back to sleep. He threw a glass of water in my face. 

So there's that. On Saturday, I came back from a work function and he was tanked. Absolutely fucked up. I have no idea how, or where he was, but he was still in his work clothes and I didn't get home until midnight. He spent two hours telling me, in detail, why I'm physically disgusting, why I'm nothing, that there's no way to fix all the ugly, stupid parts of me, and that I should just go ahead and jump off the balcony. We live fourteen stories up.

So I left. I went to the lobby, I called 911. The police came, and I don't know what happened in the interim, except that the next day he was out on bail and the police called to let me know that the conditions of his bail involve not seeing me, contacting me, etc. 

I've spent the last week talking to his lawyer through my lawyer, because there's no way to get around this without a bail variance, and this apparently won't happen 1. for another month and 2. unless I make a statement. The charges are out of my hands.

The thing is, he's been spiraling for a long time into this bizarre, cloudy place of paranoia and anxiety. He's convinced I'm cheating on him, constantly, and goes back and forth between being angry about that and seeming weirdly beaten down by it. I have tried to get him into therapy. I have made sure that he's taking his medication. Everything that happened last week completely shocked me, because it honestly escalated so fast and to a degree that I've never seen.

7727,AITA for sharing a gift with my boyfriend?,"Recently, my mom came home with a game console she won from a raffle. She said people told her to sell it and I agreed. She asked me if I wanted it and I said yes. I like video games but I only use PC. This is a console I’d been planning to get my boyfriend since he doesn’t use PC. I wanted to use it as something to bond over with him. 

My mom is now upset because I didn’t tell her what I was going to do with the gift after I said yes. She’d said that she told my dad otw home that she hopes I don’t give it to my boyfriend but didnt tell that to me until Id said it was a surprise for my boyfriend. 

Several times I’ve spoken to her about her lack of communication but she has argued against it. Instead of avoiding conflict, I’m supposed to read her mind. She has gotten to the point where she understands I can’t tell what she’s thinking, but now its a lack of communication on my part for not telling her what I was going to do with the gift she gave me.

Now she wants me to pay for it if my boyfriend is going to have it, which I have said no to. Imo, it is a gift that was free. I didn’t ask for it. I’ve never had a console or a TV, nor do I have space in my room for any extra accessories. She has now brought both my sister and boyfriend into this. 

My mom often does kind things to either be held over you, praised for, or taken away. 
- “Let’s celebrate your new job! Lunch is on me.” *changes her mind when im walking back home because she has to get her nails done at a walkin salon*
- Screaming over small things, being petty afterward
- Holds rides, trips to the grocery above your head
- Doing kind things to hold over your head

I have been trying to repair the relationship between my mom and I internally because I feel like I view her too harshly. But every time I feel ready to accept her, things like this happen. She will start issues then act like she didn’t. She doesn’t see the issue in bringing in my sister and boyfriend in an issue between she and I. It hurts hearing she regretted doing something nice for me. 

Give me different perspectives.

7731,Feeling Responsible to Keep up with his Life,"Hey. First post in a while.

Sometimes I just feel like I need to check in and prove that I'm paying attention to him?

Its been over a year, im in a happy relationship, I've distanced my head from the trauma.

So it does make me feel weird to feel obligated to keep tabs on him. It feels like he forced that from me. He made me feel like I am his mama bird nurturing and teaching him. His words were so effective that they still effect me. Everytime I had a strike of distance, confidence, etc., he would make me feel guilty. He made me feel insecure for feeling/being ""too cold"". The way he would confront me would make me feel like I was a monster for wanting distance. So I would change, I would become more available to avoid hurting him. I never knew that would run into my healing process almost 3 years later. I never knew it would make me feel like I need to prove my role to him..the role that he gave me.

(obligatory throw away)

I've been with my current boyfriend for a few years. he's never been known as the best person. He had a horrible reputation all through high school (disrespecting authority, getting people jumped, racism (unsure if it was ironic or not, not that it makes it much better) homophobia, yelling at his mother, etc)

I assumed he had matured after high school. obviously, some traits would never change. He has always been aggressive, headstrong, and also very physically assertive.

Anyway to the point.

We have a very playful relationship there have been times where we've play fought he's gotten FAR too rough. It would end in me crying. He tends to make awful comments very loudly in public either in English or in our shared language about the looks of people mostly. He seems to never have stopped being negative. Will he raise his hands at me or do things to make me flinch for seemingly fun(?) he does it in public too I think in public he just wants to get reactions from people.

he's always talked about wanting to beat people up and now I'm getting worried I'm next no matter how much he tried to say I'm not.

I have been abused my whole life and all my alarm bells are going off. I would be so thankful for an outward opinion on this, please!

I've been doing okay, he's still in my head every single day but I'm getting through.

My ex worked on cars and electronics constantly, getting frustrated, then when I tried to help he screamed and screamed at me, one time he physically harmed me. It was so triggering because my ex started screaming and forcing me to stay whenever he fixed anything, so when my boyfriend got a bit frustrated fixing the Bluetooth I completely shut down, he didn't know though. And I could barely speak, we were in a gas station parking lot, I was in the passenger seat, a car parked next to us and I looked at the driver, I got stuck feeling like I was that helpless girl begging with no voice for someone to help me. I remember making eye contact with anyone I could and hoping they could see the pain and save me. I got stuck in memories for so long, I'm still spiraling. It hurts so much because I feel like I'm back, getting kidnapped, screamed at, being refused medical attention, the control he had over everything I did. It hurts, a lot. I'll be better at some point but I can't believe something so small caused such a huge emotional reaction. 

My boyfriend was so so supportive through the entire thing, asking whenever he even wanted to touch my hair, I ended up sitting on his lap while he cradled me for about an hour before I calmed down enough to speak.

7740,Holiday parenting time,"Hi I’m new here!! Divorce was final this summer. I was an idiot and let Nex write our divorce agreement. We have no written parenting time/ holiday schedule but I’m hoping to get this fixed in the coming year. I thought (I don’t know why I believed this) that he could be fair when it came to our kids and we could work things out between ourselves.
Now he is punishing me bc I have a boyfriend and declared he would have the kids for all of the holidays EXCEPT New Year’s Eve. I found out a few weeks ago that he had made plans for himself and the kids for NYE so I knew he was going to renege. I didn’t make any plans and mentally prepared myself for him to demand the kids at the last minute.
WELL that minute has come! Today he emailed me (he no longer has my number to text bc we were on a family plan and he cut me off without notice. I got a new number and will not give it to him.) He asked what time “I want him to pick the kids up tomorrow.”  I’m not going to put up a fight bc I knew this was coming, and I feel it will look worse for him if he deprives next of holiday time at the last minute. 
My mom suggested the following wording: 
“You told me I could have them but I then they told me you booked a dinner. So I knew you’d renege. I will drop them off at 10. Next time please honor what we agreed to.”
I’m not planning to email until tomorrow morning so I don’t get sucked into a back-and-forth before I drop them off. Whenever it’s his day (when it’s not a school day) I drop them off w him at 10am so I want to be consistent. I knew this was coming so I am not overly emotional about it... of course I’m bummed not to be w the kids and I had an emotional response getting his email (my heart starts beating HARD in my chest and I get so anxious when I know we’re going to have a conflict) but it’s not the end of the world. Tonight I enjoyed a night of snacks and board games a the kids like I would have planned to do NYE anyway.
Thoughts?? Anything I should add to the email?? I’m pretty proud of getting ahead of him so he can’t blindside me this time!",yes,no,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
7743,I’ll be taking my ex narc to court over custody,"And I’m terrified. I took the retainer fee to the attorney today and was so anxious. Our divorce was finalized in December. We didn’t go to court because he never responded or contested anything. 50/50 custody and no child support. Well the order does not state who has residential custody (I have had our kids full time since he left in May last year). He has since moved 7 times and been with 5 different women in the past year. He’s not stable in any way shape or form.  He lives hours away in a different state. I’ve been told by 2 of his ex’s that his plan is to get the kids for a weekend and not bring them back. I can’t have that happen so I’m taking him to court to hopefully get full custody but I’ll settle for residential custody and a visitation schedule. There is so many things he’s done that I now feel full custody with me would be in the best interest of the kids. I agreed to joint previously because I hoped we could co parent and do what was in the kids best interest. Also because I was, and still am, scared of him. I was still trying to make him happy because it was easier than fighting him and dealing with the threats. 

The lawyer I have has a very good record for winning cases. She’s come highly recommended. My boyfriend hired her years ago for his divorce and custody and got full custody of his kids. I’ve never done this before. What can I expect? I’m scared. He won’t get served for a while therefore won’t find out for a while. He won’t be happy. I’m just glad I was able to get a lawyer to get this taken care of before he takes the kids from me for no reason other than to hurt me.",yes,no,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred
7747,is my boyfriend abusing me?,"we’re 20 years old, we’ve been on and off for 7 years and we got back together again about a year ago. he is much bigger than me and knows he’s strong. the first time i questioned if he was being abusive or not was a few months ago when we got into a big argument. we were in bed and he got on top of me and got so close to my face that our noses were touching as he was “aggressively talking” in my face. later on in the night he tried to console me and cuddle but i would push him away until he eventually trapped me in his arms and didn’t let me go even if i pushed. to be fair, i am the type of girl to like a guy to not leave me alone during an argument so this was okay for me. until one time we were play fighting and he trapped me the same way he did that day and as we were fighting he says “how does it feel to be powerless in your own body”. i love him and i do love his aggression and “dominance” sometimes but now it has me questioning if this is really abuse. last night he “playfully” was slapping me (i do it back to him) but i found myself almost in tears after every time he did it. when he slaps me i used to just laugh which is probably why he thinks it’s okay. he would say that i like it. which is true i like it during you know what. every time i slapped him he would just slap me back harder or choke me or hold me down and tickle me until i said sorry. i do believe this is his way of asserting his dominance but is he really trying to hurt me ? is it abuse if he’s not intentionally trying to hurt me ? is he trying to hurt me ? i just don’t know. i love him a lot and he does a lot for me and i feel really safe with him and i know he’d do anything for me. just a few days ago we went to a concert and im only 4’11 and we were in the mosh pit and i looked at him all panicked because i couldn’t breathe and he immediately grabbed me and pushed everyone out the way so i could get out of there. when people wouldn’t move he’d grab them by their necks to get me somewhere safe. it’s things like this that just don’t make sense to me. how can you do all that to protect me but still be able to hit me even if it’s “playful”. i don’t know if im being abused",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
7748,My boyfriend accuses me of masturbating while I sleep,"So when I move in my sleep or I'm angry because he hit me or screamed at me and therefore didn't want to cuddle, he'd accuse me of masturbating. One time he woke me up in my sleep at like 1 a.m.,   told me I was masturbating. I tried to deny it, but he got irate. I admit to masturbating and he slapped me on the mouth while wearing a ring he just bought maybe 2 days before that. He cut my lips and proceeded with what at the time felt like an endless stream of slaps. I had cuts on my head, the side of my face and head by the end of it. After that I had extreme anxiety sleeping next to him, so I would wake up in my sleep every night after that. The fact I was waking up at night, however, just confirmed my masturbation issue.

I tried to fight the idea that he knew I wasn't masturbating at night, that he's just messing with my head, but I don't know.... I keep thinking he knows I'm not doing it and he is just purposefully like trying to give me anxiety. Do you think he might be..

His heart always beats super fast when he thinks I'm doing it, so there's no way he's doing all this on purpose. 

Do you think someone can masturbate in their sleep without knowing it?? I always get wet when I do masturbate, but I'm always dry when he says I'm doing it. Am I insane ?

7751,Life after an abusive relationship,"So I was in an abusive relationship for 2 years. Physically but mostly mentally. I done counselling, spent years working and building on myself and now I find myself in a loving, healthy relationship.

In my head, I thought I had all the issues I developed contained and under control. Now however, I find issues coming up that I didn't realise were gonna be an issue.

So the man im now with never fails to reassure me and does everything in his power to make sure I'm alright. However, in my mind, I'm always searching for red flags thus I end up making the tiniest of things a big deal. I've found myself starting most of the issues and getting worked up about the smallest of things. 

I feel like I've also picked up some toxic habits. My ex used to turn his phone off and ignore me for days if I brought something up. I sometimes find myself doing the same when I get worked up as if I'm trying to run away from it all which may make my now boyfriend feel bad. 

The other day, I brought something up that I wasn't happy with. I was fully prepared for an argument as my ex would turn things against me and it would cause a full blown argument. So when my now bf turned around and apologised, I didn't know what to do cause I had mentally prepared myself for an argument. It took me a good few minutes to chill my mind and find a chill response because my mind was baffled.

There's so many other things but my mind has drawn a blank. What I wanna know is, how did people find getting in a new, healthier relationship after their abusive one?

7752,Can a relationship survive after physical violence?,"
My boyfriend (m/38) and I (f/38) recently had a really traumatic experience that affected me more than him. He took care of me for a few days and then decided he was done and started prioritizing other things. This made me feel really sad and insecure and in a very misguided moment I showed up at his apartment to let him know I needed more support. He had a big job he was preparing for the next day and was clearly annoyed I was there. He asked me to leave and I said no. He then picked me up, dragged me out of the apt and slammed me up against the wall in the hallway several times. I have bruises on my arms and my back.

I feel that what he did was wrong, but I think I was also abusing by violating his boundaries. When we spoke about it after he just kept saying “this is a huge job.” He’s now flown across the country for a week and I feel alone and devastated. I keep thinking of all the things I could’ve done differently and I’m so sad and ashamed. He’s so angry with me. Is there a world in which we survive this?

7757,He could've killed me,"My boyfriend and I have been together since high school. It's always been rocky but we somehow made for almost 10 years now. We have a 6 and a 4 year old daughter.

He's a violent person. I knew that when I started dating him and I'm not a saint either. He has never hurt me though, at least not on purpose. We love each other and he loves our daughters. We've been trying for another baby because we also want a son. He's been unusually doting these last few weeks.

Last night I woke up to him kneeling above me. He had this really strange look in his eyes and didn't say anything when I told him to get off of me. He then started choking me. I was still half asleep and this might not be what actually happened but I remember him leaning down and whispering in my ear that he should've done that a long time ago. 

I did fight back. I was scratching at his arms and face and even broke a nail. I actually thought I was going to die and he just stopped. I was so fucking pissed. I kicked him out, literally. I just remember kicking and hitting in his general direction and him not even fighting back. He just went down and spent the night on the couch.

When I came down this morning, he was making breakfast and joking with our daughters. If it weren't for the pain in my throat and his black eye and scratched up face and neck, I would've thought it had just been a dream.

After breakfast he apologized to me. He said he sometimes felt that way about me but tried to keep it under control because he loves me. I honestly didn't know what to say to that.

I still don't know how to process all of this. It just feels so surreal like I watched it happen to someone else. I've never been scared of him before but maybe I should get to see a therapist. I don't even know why I'm making this post. It sounds absolutely ridiculous when I type it out. I think I just wanted to share with somebody who doesn't know me and might understand what I'm feeling because I have absolutely no idea what's going on in my head right now. So if you read all this way, thanks.

7759,"I believe I am in a toxic relationship, what would you do?","I f/37 have been with my partner m/52 for three years, and it has been progressing into a very toxic situation.  It all started off with him being amazing and offering me love, care, safety, and support.  There was a terrible situation with his daughter which raised a red flag about 3 months into the relationship that ended with my property being damaged, and him almost being stabbed by her boyfriend whom she stayed with.

He seemed to truly be on my side at the time, and so I felt the need to give him a chance.  I saw the emotional manipulation in his life when his daughter told him he would not be allowed to see her kids for not giving her money despite the fact that she is a 30 year old woman.  He told me he didn't speak with her anymore and our relationship was amazing for quite a long time after and we moved in together.

Over time I came to trust him despite some red flags.  Over time he also seemed to change his position on his daughter, and seemingly made excuses for her actions despite committing multiple crimes.  Lately I have caught him in multiple lies and he refuses to take any responsibility for them and just blames me for his actions.  Not long ago he became so angry with me over an opinion he began slamming his fists into his car steering wheel and then began slamming his fist into his hand whenever we got home like a little kid.

He has broken multiple things inside the home including tvs, and phones, and once even cut a dress of mine with a knife.  He has taken pictures of my bank account has well, and has consistently been massively hypocritical with one standard for himself and his family and another for mine.  There have been times I have drank excessively to drown this situation out, and he has taken pictures of me in an attempt to humiliate me.  I am truly at my breaking point, and trying to go into a shelter for a peace of mind.

7764,i thought my relationship was great but now idk,"TW: SEXUAL ABUSE?

my boyfriend and i have been together for a year. honestly it’s been great, kinda.. in the beginning it was very rocky. well in january, a month after our one year. i was talking to him about his ex co worker. i told him i knew he liked her and another coworker. he actually admitted to me he did. he said he liked her. she was the complete opposite of me. he didn’t unadd her until 7 months into our relationship. which was around the time he took me out on our first date. which i planned! i also begged for months for this date. i straight up told him it seemed like he didn’t want to go out. he’s barely taken me out on any dates and when he does. i plan them. and before anyone comes at me that i don’t communicate. i’ve spoken to him about planning things and all he says is he feels bad he can’t do more.. also in the beginning. he would have sex with me in the spand of 5-6 hours , 8-10 times. i was exhausted to say the least. i felt guilty for saying no because he would 
say “please just one lick, one time, i’ll just put it in once and pull it out.” i’m honestly hurt to say this but , last year of march i said no and he did it anyways. i think about it daily. i have talked to him about it and he said he thought i was joking which i don’t understand how he thought that because i said no so many times and i was really dry. he said that i was laughing so he thought i was kidding. i don’t know what to do because he seems to take care of me. but i’m sad because i feel like i was just used. i have talked to my therapist about this, but i need an outside perspective. i feel like im being dramatic.  

i’m not sure if this abuse. i’ve been through a lot of it but this feels different but also i just don’t know what to do. can he change?

 My boyfriend hurts me every where except my face because he has a good impression on everyone around him. He is good looking/charming/ “nice”. He’s put his hands around my neck, choked  me just enough to where it wouldn’t leave marks, pushed me in the wall, kicked me in my side, pushed me into objects. He mentally abused me every day as well. He doesn’t physically abuse me every day.

 I remember a time when he wasn’t like this it’s almost a distant dream. We have two children, that is the only reason why I haven’t left yet. I don’t have any support. My family was narcissistic and was very mentally to me when I lived with them when I was younger. I asked them for help in the past, and they just looked the other way. 

He also pushed my son against the counter top the other day and he is eleven. A couple months ago his mom was over because me and him got into an argument and it escalated because she always has his back, no matter how is or treats me. I was arguing with her saying that of course she would have his back because he is her blood, then he tripped me in front of her and had an evil grin on his face. He knows I have no where to go.

I don’t really have any friends here except an acquaintance who is his best friends ex gf (theyre still friends) who i’m not close with and don’t know if i could trust. i’m so scared. hes gone to the gym now but i can’t look at him and have hyperventilated several times at the thought of him coming back. i don’t speak the language of his country either. i don’t know where to go or what to do. please help me.

edit ; i’m back home know. thanks for your help and those who reached out personally. hes going to therapy to deal with his anger and we will see how things go. i told him that i will leave if anything like that ever happens again and he was sad (obviously) but agreed that i would be right in doing so and we’ve got some distance between us for now (physically and emotionally). i’m sorry if this wasn’t the update you wanted and you wanted me to leave him, i was scared and now i am cautious and for now that feels right.

Am I allowed to feel hurt?,"When I announced to my boyfriend of 8 years that I was pregnant he was beyond over the moon he cried and said he couldn’t wait to be a dad. After a few days and the shock of it had worn off, we sat down to have a serious talk about what we wanted and how our lives would look going forward. He stated over and over again that he couldn’t wait for the next part of a journey and that he was so excited to have a child. So we agree and plans were made. 

At no point through my pregnancy did he ever make me doubt he wanted this child. I had HG throughout my pregnancy and at around 15 weeks I didn’t think I could deal with the sickness so I started to talk about possibly getting an abortion. He talked me out of it. My sickness got worse and I had to stop working. I was hospitalised multiple times and by the end of my pregnancy I weighed less than before I was pregnant. But everytime it would get too hard he would remind me just how great everything would be and how he couldn’t believe how lucky he was that I’d be the mother of his child. 

Fast forward to now three months after he’s born and just randomly the other day he very casually says “being a parent isn’t that bad. When you first told me you were pregnant I wanted you to have an abortion”.

7772,(F 21) My boyfriend (M 19) makes fun of my skin color??,"So I've been dating my boyfriend for about 5 months now and beginning to feel a bit weary about it. I am a dark-skinned black woman and my boyfriend is mixed with his mother being black (and dark-skinned)  and his father being white. 

I can be self-deprecating when it comes to certain things like my forehead or my height but never about my skin tone. Lately, my boyfriend has been making comments about my skin tone and I don't know how to feel. Maybe crazy is the word. I'll tell you the few instances in which what he said. 

First, we were shopping around Walmart and he was talking about nicknames bc I have so many nicknames under my belt. For some reason, he suggested the nickname for me “Darkie”. I told him I didn’t like that name and that it was weird. 

Another instance was when I was tending to customers and they asked about my background. They assumed I wasn’t native to the state but in fact, I was. Maybe it was my accent or my parents being Caribbean. The conversation was cordial I didn’t take offense I like to represent my ethnicity. However, when brought it my boyfriend questioned why they would think I’m not a native he said it was “because of our skin tone they think ur exotic” and the fact that there aren’t “too many black people like me in our state”. Which is stupid though our state is predominantly white I feel like there are skinned Americans who live here. 

Lastly, I was picking up a plant that had dirt on it at my job. It surprised me because it was wet and cold and he said “Why are u acting like that it's ur skin tone?”  

The weird thing is that he never says it with malice but I think having a black mom he would know better. I'm going to talk to him about it the next time we meet in person.

Just want to make it short because I want to really sleep right now but I cant sleep. Like it's already 3:39am while I am typing this, my mind is tired but i cant sleep.

I just found out that my ex ( started and broke up 2011-2019) is getting married soon with the ""affair other woman"". It's just that the flashback of the trauma and manipulation keeps on coming back. My memory also keeps on reminding me of my five-year younger version of myself, who's been emotionally tortured. When I think about my younger self, there's something inside me that is still crushed because i completely believe that I do not deserve it, in fact,  nobody deserves it. And by all means,  no person should be put through that situation ever. 

Sorry if i didnt elaborate the details of cheating because im really tired rn, but happy to share it next time. 
Anyway, I have a boyfriend now and I really love him, he's a really great guy and I feel loved,validated and respected. I genuinely dont have any feelings for my ex and I do know through my very deep core that I do not want him back or anything to do with him. I am just hurting in behalf of my younger self when i try to think about it again.

7778,"2 years after finding out I was being cheated on, AP has moved into a house on my street","2 years ago found out my ex was cheating on me while I was dealing with presumed breast cancer (turned out to be a misdiagnosed fibroadenoma). The day I found out about the cheating my ex moved in with her and I spent the better part of a year in a spiral of self destructive behaviour and instability with housing and toxic relationships. Had a boyfriend briefly who also cheated on me and when we broke up the AP reached out to him and SLEPT with him to ‘get back’ at me because she lost friends when it all came out.

Last year I turned over a new leaf and found peace, moved on, got a better paying job that is great and found a new boyfriend I now live with happily and feel secure in a way I haven’t before. Come last week I notice AP’s car (it has a custom licence plate so its distinctive) in front of a house. All week its there. On the weekend I see AP moving boxes of her stuff into the place. After a very tense conversation I discover she has moved onto my street. Not intentional, no way she knew I lived here, and we live in a city of 3 million people. 

My stomach is churning all over again and it feels like no matter how hard I try I can’t escape something that really screwed me up. I feel so closed off and try to avoid giving too much of myself away and distrust people far more.

7780,Okay so... how are we supposed to love again?,"Hi everyone, my husband cheated on me October 2022, a few month after our wedding day. I've been going through divorce since then. This past summer I started dating again, and I've found a sweet and caring boyfriend who is understanding and supportive as I continue to navigate divorce. Sounds great right? So what's the problem? 

Me and my new bf have been together five months and I don't feel any feelings of love. I feel fear. I feel like I can't trust myself to make a good decision or enforce boundaries. I am crippled by the thought that I am just replaying my old patterns and he's going to cheat on me. I find it impossible to get past this. Now, I am going back to therapy to discuss as it sounds like some level of emotional unavailability. I guess I'm torn because people have these popular refrains:   


* ""When you know you know."" I DON'T KNOW!? 
* ""The right one will make you feel safe."" When I look at his actions objectively he is not doing anything that should make me feel unsafe. But I feel unsafe. 
* ""Listen to your intuition."" I have had strong intuition in the past but this feels more like anxiety and like I'm leading with fear. Or maybe my blocker for feeling love is some sort of intuitive knowing that he isn't a good match for me. 

My question is: for those who have dealt with infidelity in the past, have you experienced these feelings in new relationships? Is it something that highlights more work we need to do or is it our instincts/intuition telling us this person isn't safe to love?

7784,How to accept you weren't enough,"Throw away account. my boyfriend cheated on me (f30) with a 'friend' who is much better looking, more highly educated and extroverted. They have since started dating. Supposedly it was only emotional. We dated for three years and loved together, and up.intil that point I thought he was very much in love with me, as I was with him. 

Given I'm worthless and already have maxed my looks as possible, how can I accept this and get some confidence back. The see are things I can't control unless I found a bag of money. I'm thin and relatively strong, I eat well, not very feminine body type but again, can't do much abkut it other than squats. AP is very feminine and voluptuous. I don't earn very much money but I'm working my hardest on that. 

How do you cope with knowing you weren't enough and they prefer someone else?

Edit - thanks for everyone's messages. Appreciate it. 

For context He left me because he 'thought he had feelings for someone else, my mental health and I wasn't sure if I wanted kids'. I started a PhD six months ago and have been stressed, and we decided to revisit kid discussion at start of 2024 once things calmed down. Just for some context.

Anyways I guess I just have to find someone who likes what I bring to the table. It's just hard. Thanks again

7786,Why do they comeback after cheating?,"My ex (24m) and I (24f) been together for almost 8 years. We created beautiful rs for so long but we started to grew apart last 2022 because we focused on our careers. He cheated on me with a woman he met online. When I discovered about the infidelity issue, I confronted him and the other woman. He said that he wanted to pursue her and the other woman also said that she feels bad to be in that situation but she loves him. 

I felt so betrayed because I’m very committed with the relationship we have. I broke up with him. After one week of no contact, he started to reach out. I blocked him but he makes a way to contact me. He said that he regrets it and is unsure now with his feelings to other woman. He said that a big part of him wants me back but still confused and wanted to fix himself first. My question is 

Why do they always comeback? It will be much more easier if they didn’t message me. Is karma real and tables will turn to them (him and the other woman)? How can I heal from betrayal and feeling of wanting him back? I don’t know how can people accept the fact that they are the other person and still continue the rs even though they hurt other ppl? 

He was my first boyfriend, I find it really hard to move forward. I keep on thinking that people will change from their mistakes. I was mad at him at first but the thoughts of “ seeing the good within him” sinks in. Still can’t believe that the people who says they love you can also betray you. I wonder if he truly loves me :(( this is the first time he cheated…

7788,Boyfriend cheated again but now I'm pregnant,"Last year my boyfriend, whom I lived with, had an affair with a coworker for 4 months. It was very traumatic, but he begged for a long time and was honest about the details (or so I think). Our relationship was strong, apart from the affair, and it seemed we were still in love so I took him back. I tried to heal for many months, but it seemed impossible sometimes. It still hurts.

Shortly after, he was jailed after making a stupid, impulsive decision. I've been his rock through this, I'm here for him everyday and visit him every 2 weeks. During one of these visits I became pregnant and it has been very difficult doing this by myself. He's estimated to be released a month after the baby is born.

I've soldiered on, but during the last visit I checked his phone and found a lot of text messages with a girl he used to have a crush on. He confided in her, told her about our arguments and sexted her a lot. It was extremely explicit and they sent each other sexual videos. One of them being a video he had taken of us just 2 weeks prior, where we are having sex and I am visibly pregnant. I felt so crushed, so cold.

I told him it's over, but I've been so sad and devastated. I know I have to be strong because he'll just keep doing it if I give him another chance, but I think of of our baby girl and how I'll be raising another child all by myself again and I can't take the pain.

7797,"Bf (29M) of 5+ years cheated, blamed me (27F) for it.","Hi,

Boyfriend (29M) had an emotional affair with his junior since August this year. They started off as friends, when I confronted about him spending more time with her, he initially denied then admitted to having feelings for her wishing for something physical to happen between them.

Promises were made that he'll keep his distance, but turns out he was just hiding things from me. I found out in the first week of December while casually catching up with the girl (we are friends). The girl was unaware and was hanging out as friends meanwhile the guy was being a cake eater. When confronted, he regretted getting caught. He cut all contacts with her ONLY because the girl asked to not hangout anymore. When I asked, he replied ""it's better to die trying than thinking you would have won""

He wrote me a letter stating how remorseful he feels and is ashamed that he hurt me so much when he's supposed to love me but his actions said something else. One time he'll say he regrets hurting me so much, other time he'll say I should focus on the fact that nothing physical happened.

When asked the reason on why he chose to do all this, he said this happened because she's fair skinned and hotter than me.

I chose to leave because I couldn't tolerate this and going back and forth was exhausting. He then gave me hopes by promising he'll fix himself. 1 week of more going back and forth, he just turned the entire thing on me. Apparently, I'm hot but not hot enough for long term sustainability.

Lol, all this happened while we were planning for marriage in a couple of months. Anyway, his stance is clear now- I have to fix my ""flaws"" especially my skin color because I triggered him to cheat. Oh, did I mention- he also wants me to get a boob job done. My lacking qualities made him chose the other girl ✨

I'm just disgusted at how the entire relationship turned out. I'm grateful I'm not married to such a guy but I'm disgusted at myself that I chose to tolerate such behavior. Yet, my heart somehow still loves him. (ofcourse the version before all this happened)

I have been a lurker in this sub, but this time, I need some help. I know he won't come back, but if he does, I don't want to entertain him. I keep reminding myself of all the bad things he said, but honestly, it's affecting me and I just want to forget all of this. It's so shitty that I still have so much love inside me, I don't want to be this mess. I want to love, be loved.

7799,The triggers are relentless,"Quick context, my [m 34] boyfriend of three years cheated on me [f 30] a few months ago (while we were in premarital counseling/ planning to get engaged) and I'm still trying to decide whether to stay or leave. It was a ""moment of weakness, one time thing."" But he didn't tell me, I found out because of a social media trail. 

A huge thing impeding my ability to heal and forgive are the relentless triggers. Everywhere I go I see or hear something about cheating. It's on TV and in movies. In books and on social media. Its literally everywhere. Yesterday we went to hear music at a coffee shop and the singer was performing a song about her friend who was cheated on and for some reason stuck around. It especially didn't help to hear her describe her friend as a masochist. So, it's not just the presence of cheating in the world but also the judgment. And everytime I see it I feel judged myself, and am left wondering if I am choosing to stay because I am weak or lack self respect. 

When these reminders pop up, I'm left feeling sad and angry, and I grow distant from my boyfriend or sometimes even get snarky or snappy. It takes a long time to recover each time too. I just don't know how to heal from this...I really want to but these triggers make it feel impossible...does anyone have any ideas on what I can do?

Me (23F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been dating for 3 years.  He recently posted on a subreddit that he was seeking a female and hoping for it to be longterm. I found out about this and am very hurt. 

I talked to him about it and he said he made that post because he wanted to feel desired and that he wanted to feel in control of his life. (He's going through a lot right now aside from this) He said he hasnt messaged or met anyone though and thinks he never would go through with it. He said that I am the best thing that ever happened to him and that I /do/ make him feel desired, but that he is stupid. He has been cheated on in the past so he knows how this feels.

I am just not sure what to do. I guess I am still sorting out my emotions right now. I am bouncing between feeling numb and crying.

7810,"I finally ended it, and now he’s wanting to fight for us","My (30f) ex boyfriend (27m) has cheated on and off for our entire relationship, almost 2 years and thought it wasn’t a physical affair it was going on dating apps like tinder and websites. It came to a head after my 30th birthday where I woke up and couldn’t accept this behaviour anymore. This was 3 weeks ago now and due to me not being able to move out we have continued to live together but I can finally move back to my mums now. 

Here’s where the problem is, he has been away this weekend for a lads weekend which I never wanted him to go on due to the location of it and I know what happens at these events. The first night he had a fair bit to drink and was constantly messaging me asking me to take him back and that he wants to make it work and realised how badly fucked up. My biggest issue is he never took accountability, never told anyone the truth it was the typical ‘oh it wasn’t working’ rather than telling people the whole truth. 
The amount of friends of mine that know the truth have told me to run and stick to my guns of moving on with my life, and focusing on myself. Some have said if I give him a chance again they would support my decision but would be worried that it would happen again. 
I’m completely torn as I saw a life with him and now it feels scary the idea of starting over again, and I am also easily manipulated into things and he knows this so I can only hope he doesn’t try to go down that route.

But I did) it contained messages like “hey, how are you sexy” and “I miss you so much” I didn’t have the heart to go through more, and I felt guilty. But when I confronted him with the name of the user, he told me that person was insignificant and they have them blocked. He told me they haven’t spoken to them in forever. Which I knew was a lie. By this point his discord was closed and when I asked him to open it back up he refused. I did take a picture but he refused to admit anything still. He finally got to the point of saying yes he was talking to them but it was nothing bad, and he’d never cheat. And he won’t talk to them again. He still won’t tell me who they are. Am I being dumb for believing him, or giving him a chance. I do see him multiple times a week, and we do have share locations. I also do know the passcode to his phone and he always leaves it lying around. So it’s not like he is actively hiding his phone or stuff like that. So I really didn’t expect anything until this.

7813,Boyfriend was unfaithful and gave me an STD…,"My Ex boyfriend, I will call him Tom (30m), of 2 years has been cheating on me(27F) for months now. To give some backstory of our situation, I discovered inappropriate text messages on his phone a couple weeks ago. These messages contained him inviting her over to sleep over to his place, talking about doing drugs together(I’ve never been okay with this), so many lies and dirty messages that clearly showed that they have had sex. Honestly this broke me. I feel like I’ve just known/cared for/loved a completely different person.

I have also been tested after my previous relationship has ended so I am positive it was nothing from my past. I do want to say that I have been treated for it a few days ago and I think I will be okay. 

The reason I am posting is because I am having a hard time messaging him about this. I’ve already blocked him on my social media accounts and his contact in my phone. I honestly don’t want to speak to him anymore. I am hoping someone could give me advice on how to notify him or to notify his other “partners” without them knowing it is me.

He told her it’s best not to drag on something that doesn’t work. Then continued to ask about the sex which made her feel uncomfortable. He apologized. They had other conversations back and forth. A few weeks previous to this I had sent him nudes and the time stamp of him reaching out to her coincides with right after I sent them to him :(.  He has been messaging her on messenger in private conversations too. This is just what I do know. He’s also addicted to porn/sex and kratom. Idk
What his healthy outlets are besides football. I feel
So lost and alone.

He told me he had feeling for guys when he was younger which made me feel closer to him because he opened up. I just want to be close to the one person I love. He said he was depressed and had feelings of suicide. 

We are 10 years married and he was unfaithful to me previously. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel like it will get brushed under the rug like it did in the past and this will happen again. Insanity. And I will be in denial of what happened/or go crazy.  I need help and I have nobody to talk to. Alienated from others and finally reaching out here.

I remember letting him know a couple of months back that I had gone through his phone and he said “well you didn’t find anything because you would’ve left”
I didn’t leave. I was hoping that if I checked again at some point in the future, they would be gone but they weren’t and he was still messaging that same girl (in September)… the excuse being “ we were arguing a lot at that time” 

I don’t feel secure. I am very insecure in our relationship. I’ve been telling him for months that I don’t feel appreciated or loved. And nothing has changed. If anything it’s gotten worse. I’m not supposed to ask for reassurance more than once at any given situation. And if I speak on something that’s bothering me or hurt me more than once I’m just being repetitive and delusional. And I feel like a waste of space… 

Especially after hearing that our arguments are the reason why he goes and text other girls.. 
I don’t feel comfortable with him  having as many female friends as he do & he keeps telling me that I just need to get over it and that I’m insecure… the fact that  he’s going out tonight, and I know exactly how pretty those girls in the rink are terrifies me.. there’s nothing stopping him from cheating- nothing. 

He’s show me how easily replaceable I am.  Hes shown me how easy it is for you to “fake” cheat.(that’s a longer story please don’t ask) I can only imagine how easy it would be for him to actually cheat. 

And I can’t help but feel like the only reason that he don’t have me on his socials like he used to is because hes protecting other girls feelings or he don’t want to lose the girls that he’s texting on the side.. I feel like I’m being hidden. 

And I don’t think I’ve had an opportunity to actually feel/ grieve..

The last time it was brought up, we ended up fighting all day about everything around it, and not the actual part that broke me. 

I feel lost and confused. Because I love him with everything that I have and it feels like it’s not enough. I feel like I don’t do enough to keep him happy. I would give my last breath so he could have one more; but it feels like it’s only a matter of time before he decides I’m not worth anything anymore. …

I have a new job, I’m back in school, I look good, I am sober and happier than ever. 

We were together 7 years since I just turned 19. He was 23. He cheated with his best friends little sister who never had a boyfriend before. He had a full blown double life. Worked for the family company too. 

My ex and I became friendly again. His teeth started rotting, he hates his job, he doesn’t even have a car and lives at home with his mom who he hates. 

I’ve been dating. He kept asking me for rides and such and I said “we are not together anymore. After your disrespect I’m not going out of my way for you”. He told me “you changed”.

We had plans to get dinner and I drove one hour. He cancelled when I got there saying he was stuck at work.

He kept apologizing and I ignored him. 

Two days later he messaged me “AP and I never broke up and we’ve been dating the whole time. I want to make things work with her and I’m done talking to you I’m sorry”

I asked him is that why he blew me off and he said yes. Then I said why talk to me again? Are you getting serious with her and that’s why you can’t talk to me? He said “yes. I love her and always loved her. I was always serious about her. I was just stupid and I’m a bad person”.

He said he loved her since she was in middle school. I thought that was creepy. 

I was kind of hurt because he serial cheated on me. I was never good enough to cut anyone off for or change for. He told me he’s changing because he loves her. It was weird because it seemed like he was trying to cheat with me in a way. I don’t want him, I accepted he’s a bad partner for me. I guess though I’m like why does he change for love for her?

7828,I did it. I ended it. I can’t believe it.,"I ended my 7 year relationship with my boyfriend (both 26) last night. Last year I looked at his phone and at the time, he was cheating on me in differing capacities with 4 girls. 3 years prior, I found out he kissed someone on two occasions. He never told me, I always found out through other means. 

He eventually admitted that he’s been talking to people on and off for our entire relationship. And when I asked if I knew absolutely everything now, he assured me that I did. Then a few months ago, he admits he was always involved with a girl who I thought was a platonic friend we both knew. 

I have been rehearsing our breakup since d-day 1 in 2019. Four and a half long years of hoping things will blow over, of him never really showing me any change, of wondering if he was still doing it. He is a sweet and kind soul, very avoidant, troubled. He’s never shared much of his feelings with me, not beyond the surface level things we all go through. He just has no way of communicating why he’s done what he’s done, or how he’s going to change it moving forward. 

I have longed to be the kind of woman who is strong enough to choose herself. I have so many books by women like this. I broke up with him last night, finally. I still want to beg and say “I’m so sorry, I made a huge mistake, please can we try once more”, and I’m really fighting that urge. We have talked all night and this morning about all our problems, in a way that is so frustrating — with me saying “why didn’t you let me communicate with you like this before? We could’ve fixed this. We could have been something so good”. 

My heart is so heavy. I really did love him. I still do. I loved him beyond reason, without any trust, and I knew that was so unwise. I always knew this wasn’t going to have a fairytale ending. I loved him more than I loved me, by far. We managed to compartmentalise all the issues and still have fun together, still carry on as if nothing was wrong. We were so stupid to do that. But I didn’t have the tools available to me that the time to make a wiser decision, I was so afraid of being alone. And he didn’t have the tools to admit what he’s done, or know how to stop.

This has been absolutely devastating to go through and I cannot believe I have to go through this at 24. I thought I had found the person I was going to marry. The one I was supposed to move in with yesterday. I had everything packed up. I had a sneaking suspicion I needed to go through his phone after I found him in bed naked after a Halloween party with another man. My worst fears were confirmed Sunday when I discovered he's been cheating on me with 3 men. I firmly believe he would have never told me; I'm glad I found out. I cancelled the lease on our apartment we were going to share and am currently coping with having to unpack my life from boxes and reassemble it as a singular person. I'm beyond devastated that I have to close this chapter as there were no signs up until Halloween. All of his friends were blindsided and right now I'm numb beyond comparison. I just lost the best thing that's happened to me up to this point in my young life. Our lives our so intertwined and I don't know what to do about anything right now. I'm thankful we live in my hometown where I have family and high school friends etc. But we were so serious. We had just had our three year anniversary.

7830,"Had my first boyfriend at 28, he cheated, now I’m 30 and alone.","For some reason it took me (30F) all of my twenties to find someone I clicked with. At 28, almost 29, I started a relationship with my now-ex (M31). We had the most beautiful relationship. We moved in together to a new state last January. By February (1.5 years in to our relationship) I discovered he was in Tinder, Hinge, Plenty of Fish, and even Grindr. I was shocked. I tried to forgive. He got a new job and things seemed to be going ok. He had to use my car to get to work since his was being worked on. Then I find out he’s been screwing a 19yo waitress in my car…

After several months of back and forth I finally left him 3 weeks ago. I moved in with my sister in an entirely different state. I just went to my best friend’s baby shower and another friend’s wedding. I feel so alone at 30. I know leaving was the right choice but I feel punished and am so unhappy with where I’m at in life.

7832,"Is there ever a good time to end it? I know I want to, but I'm grieving him like he's going to die.","I (26F) have finally reached the end of wanting to try and fix things with my boyfriend (26M), who, to differing degrees, has been unfaithful for the entirety of our 7 year relationship. I found out in two major D-Days, one in 2019, and one last August. 

Long story short (I have other posts for more detail), it finally hit me that it's beyond repair - he can't show me he's changing, the only thing he changed is his phone password. I guess I can laugh a little about that now. I love and care about him, but not enough to destroy my self-worth anymore. I want more from life. I finally feel confident in myself enough to want to try and find a love worth telling my grandchildren about one day, however long it takes to find. I am not excited by my future with my partner, I have given my all and he has hardly shown any effort to change and be capable of loving me the way I now realise I deserve.  


So how the hell do I go about this, logistically? We've had two conversations in the last week, both with me trying to communicate that I feel our relationship is broken down, trying to get him to open up about it. He ends up hysterically crying while I vent and we get nowhere. But I feel like he can see its nearly over. We live with my parents (we *were* buying a house last year, but D-Day put a stop to that), and so it's really awkward to anticipate him moving all his belongings out, while my parents are around. I guess all I can do is tell them to give me some space when I plan to do it.  


Secondly, I work in hospitality. I have a stacked rota at the moment and there's not going to be many breaks until January. I'm terrified of potentially breaking up, having the puffiest swollen eyes in the known universe, and having to smile at customers then go have a breakdown in the staff bathroom. But maybe that's better than wallowing at home for the entire day every day? 

Can anyone give me any pointers on how I can logistically do this with as little pain as possible. I know that's a stupid question, it will be the most pain I've ever felt and I know that. But I'm dreading it. Anyone experienced having to step right back into work after/during this? How was it? Do I give him a set amount of days to move out -- and should I be there for that? Where do I sleep? I have no clue how to do any of this.

He didn't text me after a certain time, he would not answer my calls, I would barely see him, etc. I kept asking to go through his phone to see for myself. I asked for over a month.
He would say ""No, you don't trust me or something"" or something similar. One day I asked for his phone and he gave it to me to look through. Told me I was not going to find anything (He thought he was smart at hiding and thought because he had so many messages he could hide it....I in fact found a bunch of messages where he was sleeping with multiple people. I think it was 7 that I found...| am also pregnant and he's very aware of that. I have never cheated on him. After finding all that out I forgave him almost immediately. (Well after releasing my anger out by beating him up) I am not mad at all I don't even hate him.
 Might I add, I did feel bad after hitting him and I did apologize. I have never hit anyone before, so I was actually shocked I did it. I also used the term beat him up loosely. I did slap him a couple times and I did punch him. I am also 4 months pregnant. I also don't know how I failed to mention...: he cheated the entire relationship

7840,Can I move past this?,"Recently found out my (f39) boyfriend (m43) of 18 months cheated on me a month ago with a colleague. He was sober at the time & states it happened twice over a 2 week period. He stopped it after the second time as he said he realised he was going to lose everything (being me).

He confessed 3 weeks later, mainly because there was a risk of STIs (thankfully I'm clear), he seems truly remorseful, states he's never done anything like this before in long term relationships (something he said when we first started dating & talking about these things).

I'm devastated. He's the first person I had ever truly trusted, the first person who I really felt seen & supported by. He seemed like a golden goose - emotionally intelligent, politically intelligent, loads in common etc. the works. I thought he would be the one I would marry, after years of believing that person didn't exist.

Then he cheated.

He has said that he doesn't understand why he did this & said that he intends to start solo therapy to work that out. He has apologised & told me that whatever I need to help rebuild the trust, he will do it.

I have solo therapy booked too but for now, we have broken up.

Is it really possible to get past this? Is it really possible to find trust again?

7841,I started to try and break up. Then I got scared.,"I have feared being alone forever. But finally, 14 months after the last d-day (there have been lots of women, online affairs and in person), I was cooking our dinner and my boyfriend hugged me from behind. 

I just said “why are you so loving and yet you’ve hurt me like this? How can you be both? It’s so confusing”. 

We had a long night of me explaining I don’t love him like I used to. I don’t see a road forward. I don’t see marriage when he’s already broken all the vows before we’ve got there. I explained how I finally feel like I deserve more. He sobbed, and sobbed, and sobbed. I remained stoic. 

Then when we went to bed, I broke down. And today we spent all day together closer than we have in years. I’m so lost now. I was so clear, and I have spent so much time and money in therapy getting to a point where I feel like I like myself and don’t blame myself for what he’s done. Today though, it dawned on me that I love this person. The resentment I’d been sitting with seemed to filter away and I saw a scared boy in front of me, telling me he would have to close his business, sell everything off, move home to his mother. The business I helped him build. His dream.

I don’t know what to do. I said all the things I needed to say, but now what? I felt closer to him today than I have in so long. I sense he’s being his best self. I don’t know how to act now. I am so, so afraid of being alone and this person is my best friend.

I went through one of the worst times of my life almost 3 years ago with my ex. He even gave me an STD from all his cheating and lying, so it was all pretty traumatic…though, I’m doing much better now I’d like some practical books that I can check out to continue my healing. 

Even before being cheated on, quite honestly I’ve had some relationship anxiety before over fear of my partners falling out of love with me one day. But on top of that, now I have a huge fear of just being hurt again the way that I was. 

I do see a counselor regularly but I’m wondering if any of your counselors have given you any great practical book recommendations that have helped you get over this debilitating fear. I struggle so much with anxious thoughts in my new relationship. And I think that my love for my boyfriend should trump the fear of getting hurt but it doesn’t. It’s incredibly hard for me to avoid detaching or resenting my boyfriend for nothing because of this fear I have.

I came from hell and back to survive this pain. We had a 13 year long relationship and as far as I could have we were happy. At least that is what he told me so many times for so many years.

I did pretty good god back on the horse and got back on with my life. Made new friends , expanded my career. Threw myself on my hobby. 

I dated and met someone who I thought would be my happy ending. But he turned out to be a very broken person. Someone who is fighting hard to become better but was pulling me down significantly.

I know it sounds stupid but: I’ve endured a lot of trauma with my boyfriend but ironically, in my mind, I think I can “undo” the trauma by continuing with him. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD three years ago. 

But now I’ve reached the lowest point in my life. Finances drained. Can’t concentrate during work. No friends left. Unstable mood. 

When I break up with him, he lures me back in with promises to change. Plays on my heartstrings. I still love him dearly.

But recently I realized that he started making me jealous again. In many ways. He used to do that before, too. Would mention a woman and when I would get jealous, he would have this sparkle in his eyes and grin sinisterly.

Why is he doing this? Is he doing it on purpose?

At this point I’m feeling totally drained. I’m feeling brainwashed. I’ve lost many things in my life because I clung to him. I don’t see why I should get up in the morning. Will my life always be like this?

There is no joy left me in me. I feel like I am drowning. And he’s twisting the knife deeper and deeper.

After the abuse, the way I experienced and saw my life changed completely. I suffered from C-PTSD, depression, lost all motivation to pursue pretty much anything in my life. Over 2 years later, I feel like I can start again with my life. My PhD has been put on hold, but the world of academia - its exploitative nature, its failure to provide any support in my journey to feel better, the ego-battle it feeds - doesn't feel aligned with the person I have become and the values I hold dear as a result of my experiences. 

I feel deeply drawn to a career in the criminal justice system - having been closely involved with the police and court processes and the preparation for trial that will take place in the near future - but I'm worried about starting from scratch. I am 27, based in Scotland, and I have considered working towards a career as a Detective or in Law.

My own mother continually sided with him, gave me excuses for his behavior such as his former childhood abuse, not having a role model, etc. (I know that’s not any excuse now for how he treated me, but it definitely enforced the trauma bond hearing it all from my own mom, & having them both gaslight me into thinking I was the problem), she did not seem to care about the years of neglect, cheating, abuse, etc. because she would probably still gladly kiss his a$$- she’s always seemed to treat him as if he can do no wrong.

But, he seemed the absolute farthest thing from a Narc so I proceeded. We started spending a lot of time together.

Eventually though, sure enough, the Narky traits started popping up. I began to notice a selfish streak and that he lacks empathy. He takes offense extremely easily.

He is argumentative while at the same time accusing me of ""looking for a fight"" if I try to resolve an issue with him. My Nex used to say the exact same thing.

7887,I don't I will ever get out of it,"My boyfriend is a covert narcissist or I think he is , I don't know anything anymore.
And I am not happy with the things cause he can be mean then he can be very affectionate it is very confusing.
Lately I have been with my parents visiting and I think I know why am I too afraid to leave my narc bf.

My parents are great.they love me and my sibling.
Also supported us with our aspirations.
But I always felt a little left out.
My sibling is outgoing she is amazing and I love her but I think she is more suitable for our family I am like I am not the right choice.

All I wanted to be is a good daughter make my family proud.
I am not bad you know have done my masters I am doing pretty well at my job.

But it's the small things I always feel left out.
And I always felt all our family friends preferred my sibling.

And I met my bf he was my person , he liked me and I always wanted my person cause I am an introvert I have hardly make a connection.

And we have a connection.

But now it's all crashing down.
It's stupid, believe me I know it is probably all my imagination.

But I feel so left out and lonely even when I am surrounded by the people I love.

I just want to hide.
I don't think I am ready to lose my bf cause I don't want to be everyone s second choice.

7889,"My (28F) BF demands I agree with HIS perception of MY thoughts/intentions/beliefs; I'm forced to admit to being a ""liar"" for disagreeing with what HE thinks my thoughts *actually* are. What is this called???","I somewhat frantically posted here multiple times after a particularly terrible fight with my boyfriend where he called me many terrible names. (See post history).

I became increasingly aware that he is actually manipulative and perhaps emotionally abusive.

What I would like to know: is there a term for the type of manipulation where you call someone a ""manipulative liar"" if they disagree with \*your\* (false) perception of YOUR thoughts/emotions/ideas/beliefs/intentions??

**This is how our fights almost ALWAYS end: he won't let go of the fight until I ""ADMIT"" that I am ""lying"" and/or an a-hole, or both.**

He'll go on endlessly trying to \*force\* me into ""admitting"" to being a ""liar"" simply because I don't agree with his perception/perspective of what he \*thinks\* MY thoughts are. He assumes the worst of me in arguments always. He always thinks I'm conniving/manipulating/intentionally trying to hurt him. He wants to force ME to deny the very reality of MY OWN thinking and ideas. Because he THINKS he can read my mind/know exactly what I'm thinking/what my intentions are, IF I disagree with him (say that my intention/thought WASN'T \_\_\_) THEN, I am a LIAR. He says that I'm either not ""self-aware"" or a lying jerk if I refuse to back down on what my thinking/intentions are. Only I know my thoughts but the argument + verbal attacks won't stop until I verbally deny my actual thoughts.

What is this?? Why does he do it? My head is constantly spinning at the end. I'm left with two choices: continue the fight (meaning I have to succumb to more yelling/verbal insults) OR deny my very own thoughts + reality and agree with his perspective, by saying I'm a liar (and thus, ironically, lying).",cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
7891,Having trouble with dating,"The narcissist in my life was a parent, not a partner. It led to some unhealthy relationship dynamics with boyfriends, but nothing really worth mentioning here. My first relationship was very toxic on both ends, because the relationship model I had at that point (first year of college) was my narcissistic mother and enabler father, but the others were the standard mix of bad decisions, bad fits, and bad timing. I'm still friends with my two most recent exes and one (who identified my mother's abusive behaviors and gave me the support I needed to get out) is my best friend. We realized a few years back that we were better as friends than as SOs, but he's continued to be a positive influence in my life. I say all this because I want to establish that I do have a relationship history, and it's not entirely, or even mostly, negative.

For the most part, I feel like I'm taking the right steps to dealing with my trauma. I've got a therapist, and an incredibly supportive and understanding ""found family"". I can meet new people and make new friends, I've been able to successfully transition jobs into something directly in my field, and I'm happily independent of my parents' support and control for about 3 years now. I have bad days -- when I'm notified of family funerals, spending holidays alone, navigating birthdays, etc -- but overall, I'm in a good place.

My struggle is this: In my last relationship, I realized how abusive my mother has always been and went NC. Since then, I've had an incredibly hard time with dating at all. I've gone out with a few guys, tried online dating a few times, and socialize when safe (the pandemic has made things harder, but the problem predates 2020). However, each time I start trying to put myself out there, I have waves of depression and anxiety. How do I avoid repeating old patterns? How do I end things if I'm not happy? I feel like I've completely lost my ability to trust potential partners not to take advantage, or to be willing to put up with me on my bad days, like Mother's Day, when I may need additional support. It has consistently happened after a 3rd date, or about a month into online dating, and I freak out and abandon dating again. I'm getting to the point where I don't know if I'll ever be okay to date and maybe should just focus on non-romantic relationships. 

Has anyone else struggled with this in their recovery? If so, what has helped you get past this hurdle and find lasting, healthy relationships?

7892,Feeling supported when no one gets it,"I don't often get triggered into genuine upset very often, but this morning was the perfect storm. My boyfriend sent me the Kellyanne Conway video this morning, which in itself was not triggering to me. We were talking about the video after and it became clear to me that he doesn't understand that this is the type of abuse that went on in my house. He seemed to view the video as if her daughter was calm and in control, not dissociating or receiving targeted abuse. He did commend her bravery, something that has never been acknowledged in my own abuse story.

About an hour after watching this video, I received a late Xmas gift from my Nmom. I won't get into the contents-- it was just full of triggers. It also contained a note instructing me to throw away or donate the items I don't want, because she knows I won't want them. Why send it then? I tried to communicate with her after, but it went over her head. She just said ""people give gifts on Christmas"" and tried to make it about my dad, who has been gone for years. I don't want gifts from her, and have said this before, because they upset me.

I just wanted to see my partner at the end of the day. I don't often cry, but I have been crying off and on since this morning. He called me and just had a lot of blunt replies, like ""I guess you just can't have a relationship with her"". I ended the call quickly because I just didn't want to be on the phone trying to make a case for a situation I've been struggling to communicate my whole life. I find it very difficult to accept people's attempts at comfort when I know they don't understand the problem. I feel guilt when I see the wholeness of my mother's mental illness and generally horrible life, and feel invalidated when people fail to recognise my situation.

7919,I hate Christmas and New Year's eve because of NFather,"Before I begin, I'm French so sorry for the English mistakes I'm about to make.

I was raised by a narcissist dad, whom I escaped when I was 17. I went NC for 3 years, moved to another country, and I have renewed contact due to money issues (he won't recognize everything, but our relationship improved, since I'm an adult and he sure knows I'm strong enough to leave him out of my life if I want to) 

Growing up, he used to be very irritated about the number of gifts my mother bought my sister and I for Christmas. They would start an argument right under the Christmas tree, while my sister and I hid in our room. I had to reassure her, even though we could hear them scream. 

Every December this haunts me. I cannot stand someone giving me a gift unless they are very VERY close to me

As for New Year's Eve, my entitled Grand mother would throw a party with all her family (including us and my mother). They used to dance a lot, but I hated it, and my ND would force me onto the dance floor. He liked humiliating me in front of everyone, by saying I was an useless embarrassment. Every year, I ended up crying on the couch for hours, in front of everyone, because they wouldnt let me hide in a remote room. 

I now hate dancing and I never celebrate the new year. 

Sorry for the long backstory, but we're on the 25th December, and I feel so bad about it. I needed to vent a bit. Only my boyfriend knows about this (he learned the hard way, when I burst into tears upon is gift last year), and I do not feel about bothering my friend while they are celebrating with their families. Especially at 1am.

It feels weird to be the only person in my friend circle to hate christmas. I just don't understand how i can make it the period of joy it should be. Even not celebrating it doesn't make things better.

I don’t know how to move forward.,"Today is really hard for me because it’s my ex-boyfriend‘s birthday and two days ago was the day that we were supposed to have a baby. We broke up in March 2018 because he cheated on me while I was pregnant and then he did not want to work it out and then near the end of our relationship he was physically abusive. I really want to tell him happy birthday because part of me has a hope that it would make us reconnect. I don’t even know why I want to reconnect with him because he is definitely a narcissist but I love him and my life has not felt the same with him gone. I think about him all the time and I am aware that it’s very unhealthy. I want redemption for our relationship and I want it to be healthy and I want to have a baby with him because of what we lost. I can’t tell him happy birthday because I’m pretty sure he’s with a girl that he cheated on me with and the last time I try to reach out and talk to him just about helping me through the pregnancy he said that he would and then he ignored me.  I honestly don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to forget about him and move forward but then there’s a part of me that just wants him to come back, so that we can experience the good times and maybe have them thing better than what we already had but he really doesn’t want me anymore he’s so infatuated with the girl he cheated on me with.

He also allegedly filed a restraining order against me (again for what, I don't know).

Examples of things he would do:

Spit at my face after I caught him messaging other girls

He gave me whiplash because I wanted him to go to the mall with me and he wanted to leave me at the mall and go somewhere else. Even threatened to have people beat me up.

He lied constantly and called ME the liar. He also called me someone who plays victim.

HATED when I would tell friends about how he treated me

Forced me to delete social media after multiple accusations that I was flirting with other people

7926,Discarded,"Hi,
On Thursday evening I was discarded by my narcissistic boyfriend and up until Friday evening I had no idea what he was. A friend sent me to Reddit to read up, and I am shocked and sad and livid that this has been done to me.

We were together for almost 15 years, and I am struggling not to blame myself for hanging on for so long. He withheld affection and sex for almost 12 years, giving excuses about stress, back problems etc but also making me feel undesirable (like seeing me on the bed in sexy underwear and saying “are you trying to be sexy???”). Yeah, I haven’t had sex in 10 years. And I tried to talk to him but got stonewalled.

I was gaslit and emotionally abused for years. I confronted him on Thursday because the situation finally became unbearable for me. He immediately discarded me then, giving absolutely constructed and insulting reasons - and also, he’s found a new woman, perfect because she is like me when we met.

I told him to move out until I’ve found a new place and I have friends helping me stay strong.

Still, I am so confused and shocked in the wake of realizing what has been done to me. How did I get sucked into a trauma bond for so long? I didn’t talk to anyone about this until a few months ago, which is when things also started to get so much worse. Pretty sure if I had opened up to a friend, I might have left sooner but all our friends were mutual, I had become isolated up until last year.

I feel so lost. He ran away every time we were having a conversation, I thought he was avoidant. Turns out he was as mad when he came back. He stopped communicating. It drove me Insane, I reacted to him hitting things next to my head. 

Literally I bended backwards for him not to leave. Walked on eggshells. He said he wanted to save me but couldn't and was affraid for himself. I thought I was toxic waste.

He told me He was only a shell of himself, he lost his personality. he had me convinced I was a narcissist. I was in the mental hospital for a week. I have to move back to my home country.

He moved on/and with someone new the day of the break-up. I just discovered the extent of it and the timeline. Breakup was two months and a half ago. Two month of NC.

He is still in my mind the loving boyfriend, I feel like I have brain damage. Anger is just not showing up. I am so lost.

I’ve been in a relationship for almost five years now. I met him in my junior year of high school. 
In the beginning the abuse was very overt, he called me names, used me for sex, gaslit me, the whole nine yards. Our relationship was very on-again-off-again. I lost count how many times we broke up. 

As we’ve gotten older, it seems like the emotional abuse has stopped or at least become covert. He shows remorse for his actions and words in the beginning. Things have really changed and the last year, he’s been telling me all the things I’ve wanted to hear and treating me like an equal. All the things I dreamed of when I was younger. But I feel numb, apathetic at this point. I don’t want this life, I don’t want a future with this man, but I feel so far in, I don’t know how to leave. 
I feel like it’s my fault that I’m here, I had so many chances to leave but I still chose to stay.

I have severe anxiety and depression, I don’t have any friends or really a secure support system. I am not close with my family as it is a dysfunctional dynamic. I only have my elderly father who I live with and my boyfriend. I am utterly alone and it scares me how empty my life will be once I leave him. I feel petrified and stuck, like I either stay and lose out on someone who could actually treat me better and a better life, or I leave and have to face the reality of how hard my mental illness makes it to connect with other people.

7961,How do I get back to who I was before my abuser?,"I was in a horrible relationship for 3 years, and I completely lost myself trying to get him to love me. He was in his 30s, and I was in my early 20s. It started reasonably normal, but then insults, belittling, and accusations slowly crept in, and I had no idea how to cope. He constantly made fun of my looks, my intelligence, etc. I had hopes of breaking into tech or photography ( he was in tech) and he just laughed at me. He constantly accused me of cheating, but I was working 2 jobs and never even had much time to even talk to my friends, while he was out til 3 am drinking, then coming home to wake me up to tell me how he wishes I was different.

I was young and wanted to understand where he was coming from, and even mentioned going to couples counseling, but he stated that he was ""too smart"" for therapists, which is laughable looking back. His friends also treated me like garbage. I worked a double shift one day and still came home to make my bf at the time and his friends a Beef Wellington, and his friends just kept commenting on how I need to keep up the house better. That broke my heart, and upon discussing this comment to my boyfriend, he just shrugged.

When I was mugged one day, he didn't pick me up as he was busy playing pool with his buddies at the bar. I do admit I lost it with him this day, as when I was crying and raising my voice at him, he just ignored me.

Fast Forward ( more happened, believe me) to the last straw. It was the week of our Anniversary and I couldn't afford to go to Brazil with him, so he went without me. He sent me a text saying "" Just so you know, I could have, but I chose to not cheat on you"". I was flabbergasted, as not cheating is the bare minimum in a relationship. I was so angry at this and messaged back "" Thanks?"" to which he responded "" Thanks? What I did was heroic"".

I left him that the following week and cut off all contact. However, I'm still dealing with issues regarding feeling like I need to earn love and that I'm not good enough. I am now going to therapy, but I still have nightmares about him and waking up to him insulting me.

7964,I feel like I’ve become the abuser,My boyfriend has always been emotional abusive and still is. He is physically aggressive with everything but went forever without hitting me. He is slowly escalating and it gets more ajd and more everytime. Today he put my in a chokehold but he lightens up right when he gets his arm around me. I punched him in the end as soon as his arm wrapped. I feel like I am instigating arguments because he says I am. I feel like I am the abuser now. When he calls me names and punches walls I just want so badly to charge at him and act on it. I am awful. Tonight he was horrible verbally and I charged and pushed him and said get out and he turned around for the choke hold . What do I do. We have a child together. And live together. Nobody knows our struggles as I keep them quiet to save myself the judgement of how I don’t leave. Things are find when they are fine. But I always feel like he’s holding me back from being my best self. Even when things are fine. I am too scared to leave and to finally admit to others what’s happening.

7965,Is this abuse? Please help,"Posting anonymously since I haven't talked to friends/family about this yet: 

I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) for 1.5 years. 75% of the time things are good and he is caring and loving. The other 25% of the time he has anger outbursts, calls me names, and is generally upsetting to be around. Recently, I've been thinking about the possibility of this being abuse. 

Some specific examples: 

* Extreme anger outbursts over small things (standing in the way, dropping something, etc.) that leads to him raising his voice at me significantly to the point where I am usually crying. 

* If I cry from his yelling, he will often call me dramatic, tell me ""I'm acting like a child"", and to ""grow up.""

* When he yells, I will often ""shut down."" This will usually cause him to be more angry and tell me that I'm ""not allowed to do that to him.""

* During these anger outbursts sometimes calling me stupid, an idiot, annoying, infuriating, having one brain cell, etc. 

* When he has these anger outbursts and ends up yelling at me, he typically will blame me saying that ""he's only yelling because I don't listen"" and what I did (ex: accidentally standing in his way) shows that ""I don't care about him.""

* Has isolated me from my friends by convincing me that they don't care about me, are not good people, etc. 

* Does not want me to go out on weekends or on vacation with my girl friends. 

* Has on two occasions pushed/shoved me out of his way when he has these anger outbursts (I was not injured).  

* When trying to lose weight, has suggested that I'm only trying to lose weight so I can cheat on him (I have never cheated on him or any past partners).

* Gets angry when we are not intimate as much as he would like. Will accuse of me of not being attracted to him. 

After these events he will act like nothing every happened and just carry on as normal. I avoid standing up for myself in these situations due to fear of making it worse. 

I'm looking for advice/opinions on whether or not this is abuse. I've never dealt with things like this before. I do still love him very much, though these things are making me reconsider if this is what I want for the rest of my life. It would be difficult to leave him since we live together and have pets. I also don't have many friends to rely on since I don't speak to them much anymore.

7969,30 weeks pregnant and called a domestic violence hotline for the first time…I feel like a failure,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 15 years. We share a child together already and I am currently 30 weeks pregnant with our 2nd. I miscarried last year and I’m realizing maybe it was a blessing, and having a 2nd was a huge mistake. He’s always been an alcoholic. I did leave him briefly in 2015, but he convinced me to go back. We kept long distance for a while and I started to remember the past much better than it actually was and we ended up back together. 

Today was absolutely awful. It started last night with his drinking and being upset over something his family said to him. I did my best to ignore him as he was slamming doors and screaming. This morning, as usual, he tried to apologize, but I refused to accept it. It resulted in a massive argument, lot of screaming, lot of yelling, lot of insults, lot of threats. He destroyed a desk, broke a door, told me I was “fucked for life” because I was “never allowed to leave.” He sits in the apartment, that I pay for, where I’m the leaseholder, while I have to always be the one to run away to safety when things get bed.

So today, I called the domestic violence hotline. Part of me is proud I’m taking the first steps, part of me feels like a failure for having to call. I’m definitely not worried about how I will support my kids as I make very good money. But I am worried about keeping the strength up to stick to my plan of getting him out of my life forever. And I am so worried about how I will being able to rebuild my life…domestic violence is all I know (grew up with it as a child, lived with it as an adult now).

I was celebrating our wedding, I went home early cause I was tired and we had another party the day after for our second wedding celebration
I was woken up by my husband entering home with a friend of ours, they went to the bedroom while I was lying on the sofa 
I rushed to the bedroom cause I was  cause I heard strange noises and voices. I found them having sex. the ""friend"" ran away, my newly husband fell asleep. I woke him up to ask him what happened and he started beating me firstly with punches then he threw me off the stairs then he started kicking me in the face. I was badly wounded and the day after I had to say it was me who fell from the stairs.
the next day he didn't acknowledge me at all. during our wedding party.
he did so when he was completely drunk and after a while he stopped drinking. but he beated me up again while he wasn't drunk. and it happened before whereas he was drunk or not. he's deeply sick and wounded and I can't help but love him. he says he's gonna chance but I've been told several times by specialists he won't. I don't know what to do. he's the love of my life and I don't want to leave him. I don't want to die either.

I was able to flee the scene and went to my moms house. She took me to the hospital the next day because she was worried about the swelling on my jaw and neck. It might sound stupid but I didn’t know the hospital had to report it but I didn’t want to press charges. The police took my statement and he was arrested as Florida picks up the charges. I’m having a horrible time getting through it all because I’ve never been in an abusive relationship before. This wasn’t the first time he’s put his hands on me but everything else was so amazing. I’d never met someone who made me feel so special, who supported me in all that I did. Who protected me ( from everyone but him apparently) and he always built me up instead of putting me down.( at least that’s how it felt but hindsight is 20 20 and I’m realizing the subtle put downs.) he never isolated me and actually encouraged me to spend time with my family even though they didn’t like him. But in ten months he’s put his hands on me four times and this is the second time he he has put his hands around my throat I can’t shake this feeling though that it’s my fault. I also really miss him and still love him so much. I go to meet with the prosecutor tomorrow and I just feel so lost confused and sad. I’m so angry with him for doing this to me, to us.

7978,Having trouble going to the police about my (EX) boyfriend strangling me,"My ex-boyfriend strangled me last Thursday. This is the first time (and last) he ever strangled me. We do have a pending court case for the last time he assaulted me. I am still in shock. 

I did not go to the police. I told him if he let me go home to my mother & father that I wouldn’t call.  

I do have a video and text message proof that this happened. 

I know I should definitely report this, but carrying the weight of being the reason why someone goes to prison is unnerving to me. On the other hand, I feel like I’ll be angry down the line in time because I didn’t do anything about it and let him get away with doing such a thing to me. Part of me feels like I’m over reacting because he only strangled me for less than 10 seconds. Is it worth it to ruin someone’s life for less than 10 seconds? 

I recognize that this is a trauma bond, and I will not be going back to him under any circumstances. I’m just giving reason as to why even care about his life still. 

Thanks in advance for not judging me

7980,Can we talk about how fucked up the DV hotline is?,"Maybe someone can give me some insight- 
I called the DV hotline a couple weeks ago and it’s just now occurring to me how warped it is. I called during a very scary altercation between my ex boyfriend and I, and was told there was a 45min wait time.

I can understand how there are a high volume of calls and how they may be short staffed or something but it really took a lot for me to call and reach out for help and I got nothing.

It was almost like a second-to-last resort for me, 911 being the last. I screamed through the phone begging for someone to talk to- just for someone to be there during what felt like a turning point in my life. I haven’t told my family about anything. The operator could have been the one to convince me to leave. You all know how hard it can be to leave, especially when you’re established and in a new year-long lease with no disposable income. 

It was just so gut wrenching and disheartening. I just wanted someone to BE there.

7983,Aftermath 7 years after leaving,"I left my abusive ex husband 7 years ago and I am still dealing with verbal and mental abuse. We have 3 kids together, when I left I had nothing. I was homeless and trying to take care of the kids. We have had many long custody battles and he won. I had regained custody of one of my children who was tired of living with him and he was recorded verbally bashing and abusing him. Every lawyer I talked to told me it would be extremely hard to get back custody of my children. So I was exhausted and stopped trying. I have visitation rights but it is impossible to coparent with him. He does not allow my kids to speak to me, I am blocked on their phones and he has dodged me for a year. My kids have told me in the past their father said they can’t tell me about school or anything going on in their lives. I filed a petition with the court and the moment he found out he emailed me. And not only emailed me, but also CCed my family and new boyfriend on the email. Of course the email was full of lies to make me look like an awful person to the people closest to me. The email put me down so much which I wouldn’t expect anything less. And while myself and my family know the things he said were not true, I still let it bother me. It still hurts because I love my kids and I know they love me and I did nothing to deserve being treated this way. And my kids deserve to have their Mom. I let it put me in a dark place last night. The mental and verbal abuse will stay with me forever especially when it is continued. This is why I feel like giving up so many times.

he is extremely violent and abusive and I am so scared to tell him that he gave it to me and that I want to break up with him. 

I talked to a domestic violence centre about the abuse but not the chlamydia diagnosis due to conflict of interest as the person who I talked to is someone I know personally and do not fully trust with disclosing my diagnosis with. They advised me that because I am in a high risk situation the best thing to do is to create a safety plan with a counsellor to gradually build up the the breakup instead of doing it immediately. 

However now I am stuck on how i should disclose the diagnosis it to him. because if i tell him immediately about the diagnosis it might compromise the safety plan. I have no idea what to do.

I've suggested that he see the nurse at our GP office regarding certain mild health issues, which can be rectified with correct treatment. He refused. I have the job I have now just to ensure I can cover all the bills. I tried breaking up with him once over the job issue and lack of help with household chores. He threatened to kill himself.

But that day he refused to talk to me and told he’d only talk in front of a therapist and I panicked and booked a session for the same day. 

We went to the therapist and i narrated our entire relationship to him in front of Ron. Ron added a few bits. When the therapist asked he told that he came to therapy for closure. Post this, the therapist spent some time talking to him alone. Later he spoke to him. He asked me if I could not see Ron’s inconsistency that was glaring at me. He asked if I didn’t think I could do better and was it really worth it trying to work out things with Ron. He told me to look for someone who would value me and to keep my standards high. Then he told me that he’d suggest us taking one month of no contact. 

He called in Ron and advised us to go no contact for a month. He told us to come back only and only if both of us wanted the relationship. On our way back I told Ron about the inconsistency bit. He heard me. A week later I got very sick and I had to be hospitalised. I had no option but to call Ron. He stayed with me at the hospital for a couple of days. Things were perfectly fine between us. We were laughing and watching movies. He started asking me if I loved him and stuff. Ron had previously manipulated me into getting an abortion by promising a life together. 

Next day he told me that the therapist pointed out the inconsistency and everything that he told me about Ron because Ron had told him that he does not want to be with me.

It has never been good, and that has always been my fault at the end of the day. no matter how much he “admits” to “moral wrongdoings” or says he “shouldn’t have said that”, it’s almost always “justified”. All the quoted words being things he will respond with at the end of almost every argument.

He insults me, extremely aggressively. Speaks down to me and undermines me. Makes casual jokes about my looks, intelligence. Uses family circumstances against me emotionally. Speaks bad about my family - all of these and more swap out with each other over time. I address one thing, that stops and another pops up. Sometimes all at the same time.

 very rarely none of them… those are the times that pull me back in. The conversations that feel like they have a slight glimmer of hope followed by maybe a week?? Of peace… 

I’m so empathetic, I know it comes from a place of pain… even reading back all the things he does a voice in my head is telling me he is doing it out of frustration and if his pain gets better then maybe he will to?? I feel like I owe him it or something. Like I have committed this far, I can’t just stop believing now?!? The happy memories are another link in the ball and chain… what if I never find someone with that connection again…

All this to say our 1 year lease is ending very soon, so we are having to look for a new place. And my head is telling me to shift gear and change my path because this isn’t healthy and I’ll never reach my potential if I stay.

But my heart says give it  another chance, think about the good memories, fantasise about the future… it also reminds me of the pain he is in again and all the times he has threatened suicide in the past…

8030,Dealing with a narcissistic future brother in law,"I'm in a unique situation where I'm not dating a narcissist but am living with one involuntarily. Around two years ago, my sister and her boyfriend moved in with my parents due to financial issues. Within those two years, they owe my parents thousands of dollars and have refused to pay rent or contribute to any of the bills. I recently discovered that he is a narcissist which has caused me to cut off all interaction with him. Before, I would be easily baited into arguments as he often would enter the room screaming and throwing things around. I consider myself to be reasonably secure in myself, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore and allow his behavior. He's constantly yelling at my sister and my mom. He is extremely aggressive with my sister's dog and is starting to do the same to my dog. He constantly has his friends over even though my sister doesn't like his friends or having people over. I'm not sure what to do as his anger and aggression are getting worse now that I refuse to participate. I've tried confronting him before on certain things, but the result was never productive. It always ended with him screaming and my sister going to the ends of the earth to defend him. I seriously need advice from people who have experience with narcissists. I don't have the financial means to move out and since he's unemployed, without a car, and no desire to work, he's not moving out any time soon. In fact, he plans to stay as long as possible.

I had to check in, and saw all of my friends on my list that got deleted and few pictures of my boyfriend and me, plus my three pet birds and my boyfriend's cat.

He had the nerve to ruin my new life and relationship. It seems like he is still obsessed with me. He was so angry that I kept finding the truth about him and haven't talked to him since he kicked me out in January 2021. I did change my password and tried to retrieve the pictures even reported to Facebook but haven't heard about my pictures. Why would the narcissist do that to their exes?

8040,"Hello all,","
Currently just discovered that my boyfriend of 5 years is a narcissist.  We spent the last weekend together,  and I was trembling on the kitchen floor,  broken, because he just won’t stop his rage.  Mind you,  this was his birthday,  I had planned the most happy day ever.  And he started with rage because I asked him to buy gas and he said we were late for breakfast at him mum’s.  I just discovered I can’t satisfy him.  We live in different cities and want to get married,  I can’t wait to leave him,  I feel like I have finally seen through him,  he criticises everything I do,  it starts from the fact that I am not a showy Christian,  then that I don’t cook,  then that I don’t dress well(we all have our days).  It used to be that I was fat.  I try and try to keep up with him,  but he ends up having rants and rage like every time I visit when I am almost leaving,  like he wants to suck out my energy.  I am currently emotionally detached from my family, because they hate how he is to me,  and won’t let him marry me.  Tbh they are right.  If I search really deep.  I would write all the abusive things I feel like I have experienced, but it’s so hard to let go.   Please I would deeply appreciate online affordable therapist recommendations also.  

Thank you",cannot be inferred,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred

8045,Is it over for good? What should I expect?,"Me a 27(f) and my 28(m) ex boyfriend just broke up this week. He was emotionally, verbally, and once physically abusive. I tried my best each time to get out or leave things, and I let myself get sucked back into the love bombing and repeating the abuse cycle. After simply stating something that hurt my feelings about social media and a girl’s profile he followed that basically entailed her posting nothing but her butt, it bothers me that my boyfriend felt the need to validate her. Outside opinions aside, I’ve never gone through his phone once in the year we’ve dated. I hardly ask questions aside from the courtesy to let me know what his plans are for the day, when he gets home so I know he got back safe. But maybe thats because I was conditioned to not ask questions. I think for once, speaking my mind and setting a boundary of what I don’t find okay, triggered him to discard me brashly, getting blocked. Although he’s threatened many times before that we were done, blocked me, then apologized shortly after. This one seems permanent. There’s nothing that should have caught me off guard about this but I am heartbroken. We haven’t spoken since, he told me to never call him again, my behavior (expressing feelings) was “disgusting,” and that he hopes I think about how I really “messed” for a more appropriate word, everything up by being so insecure. What should I expect now? I do feel like this is permanent. Any coping mechanisms to get me through what feels like withdrawals, and also to not think about how I’m like 90% sure he’s already got a new supply lined up.",irrelevant,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,yes,yes,yes,plausibly,cannot be inferred

The manipulation, the gaslighting. It wasn’t until half way it became verbally abusive, and it’s only gotten worse. Saying leave has always been the easy thing to tell people from an outside perspective, but leaving an abusive relationship is a lot harder than just simply going. He’s left out of his own free will telling me he’s not in love with me anymore so I accept it, and then immediately after he steps in his car and tries to come back inside, I refuse because why would I want to be around someone that just told me they longer felt romantic towards me after the previous night they told me they wanted to marry me. He threatened to kill himself. Doesn’t want to be with me, so I accept, and when I accept, it’s my fault I don’t care and he manipulates me with threats of suicide. How can I win? Recently he put his hands on me for the first time and we never really discussed it. Leaving seems more and more dreading. I can’t pull myself together. Each day I wake up and I hate myself more and more, exactly what they want. To drag you to their level of self-hatred. I recognize the situation for what it is, but I feel so helpless.

8050,I'm broken and I don't know what to do.,"Hi, I'm just really wondering if I'm in the wrong. I had a breakdown last night over my boyfriend because he just kept lying to me about his divorce and constantly dragging it out. When he met me he told me it would end in a week and because I'm an idiot I thought that it would be fine to just go along with it, since I wanted to believe what he said. Then he told me November, January and March which is now. Since yesterday I haven't eaten anything and cried for almost 24 hours because I've just reached my breaking point and he hasn't expressed one bit of empathy or reassurance towards me, he just told me it's still March and basically told me to get over it. Then because i shown him screenshots of him lying to me, showing him every date he mentioned, he then said that I twist everything and start all the arguments. Getting into a relationship with a possible narc scared me because I've had a family and friends like that and I'm really scared that he could be one. I also had a miscarriage a few weeks ago and he couldn't care less and told me to get my mum to take me to my appointment to see if theres a heartbeat still, when he knows that she won't, so it just really hurts that he said it. I'm just broken and I really don't know what to do anymore.

Also, we were meant to move out today, and he told me that he can easily replace me with a roommate if I don't move in with him and that just really hurts. He also lied about talking to his ex behind my back and was her constant shoulder to cry on when she had problems with her own relationship.

8058,Partner's Narcissist Ex-Spouse,"Let me start by saying this person has been identified as a narcissist by my partner's co-parenting counselor assigned by the courts. During their divorce, she tried to take custody of the children completely away from their father (my boyfriend) by claiming that he was a dangerous parent. She then said she would drop all of her charges if my boyfriend agreed to have dinner with the children inside of her house on every holiday. Obviously when that was proposed, the judge threw all of her charges out.
She continues to manipulate her children and isn't afraid of using them as pawns in her game. She's smart, and her behavior is very subversive. She has essentially succeeded in turning their children against their father, and has issued a campaign against me. The kids are extremely rude to me when they're around, and I always feel like the house is a hostile environment. It's difficult asserting boundaries with them because the kids scream and cry even when the adults are calm. It's really hard not to blame them for their behavior when I know it has nothing to do with me, and it's their mom in the background pulling the strings.
My boyfriend and I go to counseling together to get coping mechanisms and strategies. It's just hard always trying to be the better person and getting absolutely zero reward for it. Especially in my position because my boyfriend's kids give me zero positive energy where at least they have a biological bond with their dad.
Words of support and encouragement would be welcome. We're both struggling even after three full years after his divorce was finalized, and one year in a relationship with each other.",yes,cannot be inferred,plausibly,no,no,,no,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,no,plausibly,no,no

Meeting with my soon to be nex husband tomorrow morning to sign the final divorce decree and other documents.

I feel absolutely sick to my stomach.

He left me 6 months ago for a girl 20 years younger then him.

16 years of marriage.

Together since I was 16.

He was my first boyfriend, first everything.
I trusted him. I thought he was my best friend. I thought he loved me.

I have gone through the worst pain of my life grieving the death of our marriage. 

The day he left I felt like he took a part of me with him.
I'm not sure how to get it back, or if I even can.
Maybe I just have to learn to live without it. Maybe this hole inside of me can never be filled. A scar to bare for the rest of my life.

I am seeing a therapist, making friends, learning to take care of things on my own for the first time. learning to be independent.

I am not even sure what I am feeling. I have been trying to understand it, but I just can't. I am ready for it to be over, but it is still so painful. I feel so lonely, abandoned, lost.

Some might think I should be celebrating. After all he was an abusive, hateful person. An alcoholic, a liar, a cheater.

Everyone is saying I have my whole life ahead of me, I am young and finally free. Things will be better now. ect ect ect

The future just doesn't look bright to me. 
The loneliness is so deep. I feel lonely all the time. Even when I am with friends.

I have fears that no one likes me, or cares about me.
That everyone will abandon me in the end. Everyone just tolerates me because they are either too nice to tell me they don't like me, or because they want something from me.
I feel like a burden. I feel like I don't belong... anywhere.

So we have been living together for last five years, my boyfriend is not financially responsible for anything household related like rent , utility, groceries, I pay for it all.
And for the last five years I tried to talk to him about getting further education but apparently he thinks no college can teach him anything.
I have been waiting for him to change and take some responsibility.
He is a capable person but he just chooses to be like this.
Last year I was stuck in my home country due to travel restrictions (which was a blessing) but I had to pay for rent utility without his help.
And every time I asked him to get a job or pay we had fights.

Long story short I am very emotionally attached to him so I was not able to break off, every time I have a window to move out he convinced me that I am being rash I have fear of commitment but he never really changes.

Last night we had a huge fight cause all of a sudden he wants to marry me, and he told me I am being petty for bringing up the fact that I am carrying all financial responsibilities because he some how has money to pay for his phone bill and his car gas (which he rarely uses) so I am making a big deal about it.

I’ve been planning this mentally for quite some time, to tell my live in boyfriend it’s not going to work out and he needs to find a new place. I have journals upon journals of terrible moments I’ve hated. I’ve had to document everything so that my kind heart doesn’t forget them. Because it’s easy to. It’s easy to brush all the bad aside when the narc is being on his best behaviour and being the man I’ve always wanted. It’s not fair. The “high” cycles are intoxicating. He is present, not highly irritable, more approachable etc but logically I know this never lasts. This isn’t the natural state of being.

It’s crazy how I can have this ONE day with him and I get fooled into thinking it can always be this way. But it won’t! In a day or two it always goes back. I wanted him to be in a low cycle when I break the news so it’s not so random and out of nowhere when I end it. I’m so stressed. If he continues the good behaviour for a while, it’s not going to make any sense to him when tell him I’ve felt this way for a long time. I mean it won’t make sense no matter what route I take.

However, my home life was not okay and I could not handle the stress from work, school, and home .

He’s in the army, and two months into our relationship he went onto a year long deployment. Then once he came home a couple months later we moved in together. It didn’t take long for him to become emotionally, verbally, and eventually sexually abusive. However, I have anxiety and anytime I had doubts I would just blame it on that. We broke up last July after realizing I was never the problem, and it was a very quick mutual decision. We broke up over text and I went to the apartment when he wasn’t there. We haven’t spoken since. I blocked him on everything, but in the beginning I occasionally would check his Facebook and Instagram (not healthy, I know). And a month and a half after breaking up, he was with a new girl he worked with at his last job. I was hurt by that, all that time we spent together and he just was with a new girl that quickly was odd to me. But I’ve realized that’s a typical sign of a narcissist, they need a supply constantly. After that I’ve been just working on myself, and I’ve been with a new guy for 6 months now. Yesterday I got a text from a close friend, wanting to ask me a question. She asked what my ex’s Instagram username was, and I gave it to her. She said he liked a picture of me and her from my 16th birthday (I’m 20, btw) and then blocked her. I thought that was really weird. So I went onto his Instagram and in his bio it says they got married. I did some more digging and alas, they did a couple months ago. While I know I dodged a MAJOR bullet, I feel hurt for multiple reasons. 1) Everything I put into that relationship was never enough for him, and he still made me feel like I was a horrible partner. 2) I feel for his wife, I want her to know what’s coming and how he is so manipulative and controlling. 3) He never ever posted me on social media, but ever since they started dating he’s flaunting her. I know he’s probably trying to make me jealous or just show how happy he is, but anytime I voiced I wanted to post a picture together he never agreed. 4) Even though I know it’s not the case, I wonder if he treats her better than he treated me. It makes me question how he treated me and sometimes wonder if it was even that bad (which it was, I was very underweight when I left the situation because I was so stressed).

I’m ready to give up.,"My boyfriend talks bad about me to his friends and family behind my back. He allows his friends to trash talk me and never takes up for me, obviously because he does it to. I feel no relationship security. Anything I vent or confide in him about, he goes and tells people. Anytime we aren’t talking because we got in a fight or disagreement, he goes and talks/snaps other women because he assumes im talking to other people also. He’s made his parents and friends dislike me. Im not allowed around his family much less at events like weddings etc they are at because it will upset them, so he goes without me. If im upset and he knows im upset and I maybe don’t respond to his texts, he can go days without talking to me and trying to workout our issue, he will just get drunk and hangout with friends. & if I do try to talk out an argument with him and he’s with his friends, his phone goes on DND and he ignores me. It’s at the point I don’t like going places with him, because all he does is stare at other women with me right next to him. Their ass, boobs, etc. It makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how he can say he loves me, yet he treats me this way. Yet I don’t know how I can love someone who does this to me.

He told me that he will always appreciate me and that it’s still hard for him to move on. He mentioned that him and his girlfriend hang out all the time but he holds back tears when he gets home. He then told me to text his new girl so he could prove how good he is now and how he’s so amazing to her. Later on, he told me he was telling her that he was going to overdose because of me. When I texted her the screenshots of the text she was defending him and acting like he is just the sweetest person ever and that he would never do what he did to me to her.

8101,Still grovelling,"My abusive husband moved out a year ago and we were still seeing each other occasionally and acting like a couple. He liked this arrangement he got his needs met and got to not have the responsibility of the family. I divorced him in this time and then a week and a half ago decided I no longer wanted to have a ‘relationship’ with him anymore. Being away from him made me realise how bad the abuse was, and how brainwashed I was. It’s hard because I do love him and he was ok some of the time. But he wasn’t changing and I decided I was done. 
The last week and a half has been him on the phone constantly trying to get me to give him another chance. He is begging me. He will do absolutely anything he says. He will worship the ground I walk on etc. (he put in the absolute bare minimum for nearly 10 years). 
I keep saying no I’ve made up my mind but he will not accept I don’t love him. He will not accept we will not get back together one day. He is begging me not to find anyone else. 
I’m exhausted and drained by this. He thinks I’m making a mistake and we’d be good now and he will try harder. I need to be reminded this is just hoovering and love bombing.

8103,I was served papers yesterday,"I took our baby and left my abusive husband 10 months ago. Our daughter is 19 months old now. We live with my family and my daughter is doing really well. She's happy, surrounded by so much love, safe, and has a good routine. She's thriving. My husband comes to spend time with her at my parents house (supervised) a couple days a week. I don't allow him to take her because I don't feel that she is safe with him.  

I've spoken to a few lawyers. I don't have the needed evidence to prove his abuse (conviction or police reports) so there's nothing stopping him from getting 50/50 custody. All I have is a recorded phone call of him threatening to destroy all my stuff, some text messages with his family talking about his behavior, and very specific entries I wrote with dates and times explaining each abusive incident. He was arrested a few years ago for DV, but was not convicted because he took a batterer's class, so that doesn't count apparently. 

Since the outcome is not going to keep my daughter safe, I haven't filed any paperwork since I left. He seemed to tolerate the arrangement, so I didn't make a move 

However,

I was served with divorce papers yesterday with a request for 50/50 custody (2/2/3). I am completely devastated. He didn't want to be an active parent when we were together and I've been her primary caregiver since she was born. The last 10 months she's only been with me. I still breastfeed her. She sleeps with me and always has. She nurses to sleep. Now I'm just supposed to give her up 50% of the time? Since she's been born he's only ever watched her for a couple hours. How am I supposed to take away a 19 months olds routine and throw her into something where she no longer feels that safety and stability? How does she go from having that comfort of sleeping with me every night to losing that and being forced to sleep elsewhere without me? She's only 19 months old!!!!! This feels so wrong! 

I thought abusers tried to hoover their victims back and he just wants to discard me. He would rather discard me than take responsibility for his behavior. I don't get it. I didn't think he would actually file and let me go so easily. I'm feeling regretful for leaving because now I'm going to lose my baby and I feel like I can't protect her.

8104,How Did You Keep Yourself From Going Back?,"Married to an alcoholic who I’ve learned in the past year has put me thru all forms of abuse except for actually physically hurting me. We were separated twice last year, the abuse escalated putting the blame on me to our 6 and 8 year old.  he went to treatment, came home relapsed, lost his job then got nice for a bit  and was back home after 4 months. Then it got really bad again, he got out this weekend with the help of his family. I am done, I know even if he’s sober he will most likely be abusive to me and I think I may mentally shut down if it happened again. But I’m scared of the divorce, I’m scared of hurting our kids (even though so far they get it this time as the witnessed a lot when he came home) I’m worried about him as he’s in a hotel room and refusing to go to treatment.

8106,What steps did you take to safely and finally leave your abusive relationship?,"I’m planning my leaving now. Once I knew I wanted to levce, the reality of how much control my H has and how isolated I have been has kicked in. 

I now have a solicitor and a DV advisor to assess risk with. But no one is going to tell me exactly what steps I need to take to leave or what moment to leave (obviously imminent threat of serious harm would mean immediate leaving - and in this case my plan is to go to an air b n b because I do not have family here or friends with space enough for my children and me). 

I in my case, I am seeking my solicitor’s advice about whether I get an occupation order (requiring my H to leave the home) or whether it’s best to wait until I can save up enough to get my own accommodation and then to leave with my children and have a restraining order served on my partner at that time. 

I have been advised not to tell my husband about the divorce or plans to leave bc while it has been over a year since he did anything considered especially dangerous, the threat is always there, and he has threatened suicide if I leave as well as (several years ago) threatened to drive the car off the highway with the family in it.  

Things were brought to a head once my H hit my son with objects twice over Christmas and I reported him to social services and police. I ended up disclosing his harm to me during questioning and was assigned an IDVA due to risk. Children’s services say if I remain with my partner the will be involved, but they are giving me some time and space to leave first as they know I want to do this and I have safety plans in place to call police if anything happens. 

I was told legal advice is critical. It has taken weeks to qualify for legal aid but I finally have (my H has full control of finances and I was able to evidence this with bank statements). 

I am extremely close to finishing a doctorate and being employable. I am being considered for a position in April which would prob start a few months after. I don’t really want to pull my children out of school and flee to a shelter esp if no violence is happening at home right now. But of course the threat is always there. 

I would love to hear other leaving stories. This is a difficult phase and it would be great to see how others got thru it. ",yes,yes,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred,yes,cannot be inferred

My husband (we're separated right now and I'm working towards a divorce so idk what else to call him so I'm going with that) had convinced me to move to Canada with him to be closer to his family the year we got married. I did that and it was a horrible choice it turned out. My dad moved up there to be by me so that I wasn't so alone. He spent everything he had almost to move there with me which still makes me feel guilty. We ended up moving back to Ohio where we're originally from. My sister took my daughter and I in, and my dad is currently living with his mom, my grandma, to help her because she's not doing well healthwise. I'm so incredibly grateful to everyone who commented and supported me on that post. It genuinely helped me open my eyes and realize that none of that was normal. I don't plan on having a relationship anytime soon ever. My daughter and I are so happy. I was able to reconnect with my family and it has been so much better. I just thought people might want to know what happened and I just wanted you all to know that my daughter and I are safe and happy, an entire county away now back HOME. This feels like home...

I learned about years of controlling behavior from my father and have seen interactions between them that mirror past ones between my ex and I. 

I’m fucking miserable and so scared. She said she is going to try therapy for herself and see if he will see what she’s doing and change his own ways. But I doubt it, and I honestly think she’d be better off leaving. Of course I told my mom I’m with her no matter what she decides. But here I am again, no job and dependent on a man I thought I could trust, who I thought was a “good guy”. I’m devastated.

I've got my phone/computer totally locked because I've discussed the situation with friends and stuff.  He hates it.  My therapist says my biggest hurdle right now is my self-esteem. I have to find even a little to do this. 

I've explained in other posts before but we've been married 5 years.  Together 7.5. Love in my family home so he'd have to leave.  I'm afraid of divorce. I can't afford it.  So I have the papers for financial waiver.  He's jobless has been for almost a year. I can't even pay all the bills.  Account is $300 overdrawn pretty much every month.  I'm disabled on SSI. In school. Getting some financial aid/student loans. Planning on putting it towards bills and debts but currently am putting nearly half my monthly check to debt consolidation.  

The whole point of school was to be able to get hopefully a wfh job and get off SSI but I know it won't happen right away and might have to declare bankruptcy because I won't be able to afford all bills and student loans if the payments are large.  

I'm in a no fault state and I'm going when I tell him I want out he won't make it messy and drag it out.  He can't afford a lawyer but it's possible his dad or mom would bail him out and pay for that.  

I'm almost most scared of the unknowns here. I have other posts that explain some of the instances of this situation. In April 23 we had a huge fight.  I was ready to go and he begged me to let him change.  Said he'd go to therapy, back in his meds, quit smoking. 

Therapy lasted till August.  He's on his meds and seeing a psychiatrist but I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm waiting for his next angry blow up and I'm so confused and it almost scares me he hasn't been super angry.  He's still making little rude quips.

I'm feeling extremely guilty, but I'm also really hurt, I think what he did is so unfair -- to him and to me. I didn't deserve this pain, I didn't deserve this punishment of constantly grieving, hating myself, blaming myself, after ten years of doing everything to make him happy. 

I believe he had no malicious intent, he had mental health issues (now I'm guessing in retrospect). What he described was how he actually saw the world, it was his honest truth. Looking back, I realize he was incapable of empathy or introspection -- but he's not the one to blame for how his brain worked.

I'm hurting because all of this happened when we were fighting and I left him, our last conversation -- me yelling at him. His last message to me -- rage and anger, blaming me for everything.

I'm having so many feelings everyday. I can't just grieve. I miss him and I love him, I feel self pity, I blame myself for what happened, I'm angry that he threatened my mom and decided to punish me in such horrible way, not thinking the rest of my life will be a torture.

And also I'm hurting because I have no one to hold accountable for his abuse, and his anger, and his suicide. No one to blame. No one is responsible for all the pain I felt and feel now. I feel alone with my pain. I'm hurting from all those years and what just happened. He left thinking he was the victim, and never understood that I was the victim and it just hurts so bad. 

I really wish it was different. I wish we calmly divorced and built new happy lives after that. Or stayed together, went to therapy, worked on our relationship, and grew old together.

And very financially abusive. What makes this very complicated for me is that he is on ODSP and does not work or have any other income. Any money I make the government deducts from his ODSP payments.

8147,Divorcing abusive husband,"Hello everyone. I have learned so much just from reading some of the articles from people who have been diagnosed with NPD. Most of the articles I read pertain to the fact that people diagnosed with NPD cannot self reflect or change.

I filed for divorce a couple months ago. My husband and I have been married for six years. He pretended to be everything I ever dreamed of. 

After the wedding, which he had to change the time of the wedding to make it to his kids sporting event, I found out that he had been on dating sites and sexting, and trying to set up dates behind my back. 

He has also stolen money from my purse, forged my signature on my paycheck, and stolen from my little boy’s piggy bank, at least five times. He was caught shoplifting at Walmart last year, with my son with him. He steals from work, bringing home items all of the time. 

He’s completely obsessed with bodybuilding, he has to have rockhard muscles and weigh and measure his food or else he feels very bad about himself. 

Before I filed for divorce, I found out that he has been using anabolic steroids for bodybuilding, which explains the explosive outbursts. I was diagnosed with complex PTSD, because of his behavior. Sadly it runs in the family and two of my three stepchildren behave the same way. Stealing from me and bullying my children.

He also tricks me into paying for everything. Every time we go on a family trip, he will tell me that he doesn’t have any money after we have already arrived. He has made me pay for every Valentines and anniversary dinner.

There have been so many lies and deceit and stealing. I am very disgusted and can’t look at him the same, no matter how handsome he is. 

He is begging me not to go through with a divorce and is showering me with flowers, cards, gifts, so much affection. But I don’t believe he can change.

8148,I am really Confused,"Hi 

I have been reading your posts for awhile now and this is my first time posting. This is an amazing community, filled with compassion and wisdom, and I need both at the moment 

My partner and I will have been together 14 years this coming March. We were married for 7 years, then divorced, but stayed together (minus 6 months of no contact that ended about 18 months ago)

I grew up with an abusive mother — physically, emotionally, mentally. She was wildly violent. I spent my late teens and 20s in therapy because I knew I was at risk for repeating the pattern in adult relationships, as well as being at risk for drug and alcohol addiction, because of the trauma I experienced growing up 

I didn’t get married until I was in my late 30s, and I thought I had successfully broken the cycle 

Then in therapy last year, my therapist at the time referred to my partner as an abuser and our relationship as abusive. It threw me for a loop. I am now in therapy with a new therapist and she has also said that she abuses me and our relationship is abusive 

She doesn’t hit me. I am physically disabled and in chronic pain, so what she *will* do is intentionally leave or create situations that will cause me to fall or will hurt me.

The clearest example of this was maybe 6 years ago when she was angry with me. We lived on the second floor of a duplex and we were going to my parents’ for Christmas. I was picking her up after work and we were going from there.

When she left for work in the morning, she intentionally didn’t pack the car. There were maybe 3 bags and my medical equipment (1 bag more.) She could have taken it to the car in one load. Instead, it took me 3 loads and I fell twice

She does this kind of thing regularly 

I am going to stop now because I am getting tired, this is getting long, and I’m not sure what I am getting at — but I would like to keep posting if that’s okay",cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
8152,Grieving the loss. Denial and Bartering,"My husband has been abusive in every possible way for the entirety of our 5 year relationship. 
Classic narcissistic traits. 

After the initial 3 month love bombing, things quickly turned bad. The women, cheating, lying, gaslighting, refusal to contribute financially, verbal, mental and emotional abuse (cursing, demeaning, belittling, death threats), sexual demands (if you don’t every single day, I’ll just go get it somewhere else)… and more… 
Then a year ago he got very drunk and beat me. Close fist punched me in the face, strangled me, and threatened to shoot me if I didn’t leave in 30 seconds. I did not call the police. 

Fast forward to the beginning of December this year. (All of the above abuse still happening and getting worse) I gave the ultimatum, rehab or I’m done. I’ve threatened ‘done’ so many freaking times, no wonder he thought I was not serious. 
He got very drunk again and told me to call my kids because it was the last time I would talk to them. I didn’t know if he was threatening them or me, but I knew it was time. I called the police. Got a restraining order. Filed for divorce next day. Final restraining order hearing is Jan 3. 

Here’s my problem… 
While he’s not currently living in our home, he’s been out chasing anything that will let him. Along with whatever he’s finding online. He’s reached out to previous women, some of who have reached out to me to tell me my husband is sick again. I do not want him to hurt anyone else. This isn’t a jealousy thing, he’s been cheating the entire time we’ve been together. However, his anger and rage have gotten worse with each relationship he’s been in. 

Also, my dumb a$$ still loves him. I do not want a divorce, I want him to get help. Consciously, I know help won’t help unless he is willing, and he doesn’t see anything wrong with his behavior. 

I am in the denial and bargaining stages. Not sure what to do from here. Sad. Angry. Hurt. All the things.



I know the best thing I can do is hold my head high and know I did all I could, and now am safe. This trauma bond is not something I know how to deal with and I’m acting like a crazy person. ",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,plausibly,,yes,yes,plausibly,plausibly,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred
8155,I need to find a job first so I can divorce this man,"
This man has cheated on me multiple times while I was pregnant. I haven’t saved enough money to leave yet. I honestly don’t have the courage to leave. I’m a SAHM after my daughters birth because he insisted I become one.

He does not give me access to money, I’m using my savings to fund my life and pay my bills. We currently live with his parents in their 4 bedroom house. Only one room belongs to us and it’s my daughters room. He has a room that he sleeps in because he doesn’t like when my daughter wakes in the night.

I wanted to buy a Lego set and place it in the room that he sleeps in.

Just clothes and food. I need to find a job that pays enough to buy/rent a place but it’s so hard when I’m 100% of caretaker of baby.

Sometimes I question if it was really abuse because he didn't say and do some of the things that people claim are the telltale signs, but he fits all the boxes when it comes to how he made me feel.
I struggle the most with how he seemed to thrive after divorcing me, while I lost everything. I was the one who had to move out and back to the state I grew up in, I have been struggling to find a job since moving back in town, I have no friends and no possibility of finding an actually good husband. Meanwhile, he got a better place to live, more job opportunities and who knows what else.
I don't really want him to fail, but I did kind of hope that he might feel a little bit of the pain I've had to deal with in the last few years.

I am a very sensitive person, I feel deeply and have a lot of emotions. I thought he was the same but it turned out to just be the alcohol at the time making him SEEM emotional and sensitive like me. He doesn’t listen when I talk. He controls the conversation.  I have been extremely anxious around him lately. Like high blood pressure/headache type of anxiety. He asks me to lay in bed with him and I do because I think it will go away or that he will treat me better. He doesn’t.

8168,Is this abuse?,"I've been married for 10 years. 8 years ago I found out he was cheating. I chose to stay because I was young and dumb, and I thought we worked through it. Fast forward to 3 years ago he had another affair. It devastated me and I left for 3 months, but came back because I wanted to keep our family together for the children. We did everything to ""fix"" us. I really thought it worked. I even quit my job to work with him because that's what he wanted, but ultimately couldn't continue because he mostly works out of town and I need to be home for the kids. A few more months go by and I bet you can guess what happened next. Yup, another woman. I didn't even fight this time. I just collapsed and accepted my fate. I couldn't leave him. We have 4 kids and I had no job. He was so sorry of course and apologized the cycle continues. 

That was back in 2021. It was around that time that I uncovered so much more in terms of how extensive the cheating was. Dating accounts, snapchat, you name it. He confessed that every time we argued or I did something ""wrong"" that he would talk to someone else. He told me he never felt loved and keeps looking for it everywhere. He told me I should divorce him but that he would never divorce me. So I stayed. For more reasons then I can explain. And things were ok again until this past summer.

Now he's ""in love"" with someone else. He can't be with her because she's his new boss and blah blah blah, but he can't help how he feels. He still doesn't want a divorce. He still loves me, he's just not in love with me.

8171,"Husband (29m) says I wasted 10years of his life because I (28f) changed, is that fair?","Hi,

Long story short : we have been together since 2014, husband has always been blunt, he doesn’t like sugarcoat thing and make negative remarks almost every day about everything. I literally have to beg for compliments and for gratitude (if I took time to get pretty at home for no reason, cooked his favorite dish or else, I have to ask for thankful comments…) 

I never been to therapy and I started it 3 years ago, that’s when I realize how abusive our dynamic was but my therapist advised I work on myself and try to make things better at least on my own to not get trigger by his attitude because that’s how he has always been and I can’t change people. I shared my feelings of how it made me feel, I tried my best not to use YOU in arguments, I tried to make it better and not get too sensitive and see the negative thoughts pattern I would have if hurt. It worked a lot, but it also made me realize how often that happened without me understanding how bad the situation was. My therapist advised this because I wanted to make things work and I felt I was not in control of my emotions most of the time. Like I could cry and get sad etc…

Now since I stand for myself and allow to question on the same tone or find why he would be hurtful etc, husband is saying I’m picking fights for nothing and I am too sensitive now, not like before. Every argument blows into crazy heated discussions, he usually ignored me after because he has nothing to say more and that could go on for days, before I used to get sad and would ask him to forgive me and end the argument, however not anymore. Divorce and incompatibility have been mentioned many times, however he says we can’t throw awa almost 10 years of relationship, but yesterday he said I pushed his buttons and I am too sensitive and overreacting about all that he can’t anymore and asked to divorce. He said I wasted his time by changing and getting over sensitive, a trait he would never accept in someone because his nature is to be teasing and that’s how he is and doesn’t want to change. 

I just had to write it down and share my feelings even if I think it’s officially over because I felt relieved about this last discussion and especially when I felt like what I will miss is the financial situation comfort I was in…

8179,My husband (47M) and I (43F) have been together for 24 years and are getting divorced. Is he a Narcissist or just used to manipulating me?,"Throughout the marriage there has been some mental/physical abuse by him, but mostly the marriage has been good. We get along great and he’s always been able to make me laugh. I have always forgiven him when he says hurtful things or been physical. I’m not making excuses but he’s been to war and suffers with depression and PTSD and I felt it was my burden to forgive and help him be better. He’s also cheated on me a few times and disrespected me when around other women and his friends and although I’ve asked him not to he brushes it off. He is an attractive man, we both get a lot of attention but I shy away from attention knowing it would start a fight if I talked to another man, but he will flirt right in front of me claiming he’s just being a wingman for his friends. 

He recently came back from a work trip with another woman messaging with him. She ended up stalking and harassing me. I not only had to block her everywhere but also had to have our daughter (21) and my mom block this woman. So after this last issue I filed for divorce. I know, about time right?! But it’s not so easy when you love someone and have been in this unhealthy cycle for so long. He is devastated and can’t believe I’m divorcing him. Side note, we also have a 13 y/o son and both of the kids are encouraging me to divorce him. 

Because I worry about his depression, I have encouraged him to go out with some mutual friends and maybe have some guy time. Both times he has gone out with them, rumors have gotten back to me such as “he is leaving me because I want to have a swinger lifestyle and he doesn’t” and also that “I’ve been sleeping with other people throughout our marriage”. Both couldn’t be further from the truth, but I’m pretty positive these rumors originated from him saying this to his friends. He is denying it and saying why would he say that if he wants to save our marriage. 

Basically, I think I’ve lived in this manipulative environment for so long and have believed him and defended him for so long it’s hard to separate reality from not.

8206,"the dissonance - it's not ok, but I will be ok","I am struggling with two equally valid, real truths on my recovery path. (Married 10 years, 4 kids, I stayed at home and supported his flourishing career, he got bored with our life/me and found someone on Ashley Madison. Blindsided by his confession and him swiftly moving out. In the divorce process currently.)

The first is that what happened is deeply wrong, undeserved, disordered, unhealthy, painful, and traumatic. 

The second is that I will be ok, I will be happy, my kids will be ok and happy, and I am going to grow and become the best version of myself. 

I can feel the pain but do not want to suffer (ruminate on the wrongness/pain/etc). I have been able to reach a level of acceptance of ""Yes, this happened. This is who he is, and this is my life now."" It completely shattered what I thought my life was, but my life is not over.

I get stuck sometimes on how unfair it is that I don't have the same time, access, and connection with my kids now as I would have before. I don't just want to toss sparkles on it and say ""well, it can all still be wonderful!"" but I also don't want to wallow in ""But it's not how I wanted things to be."" I want closure from the cheater, but I know that he can't, and closure isn't really applicable to this kind of thing... nothing would feel satisfying, anyway. 

To help myself keep going, I am trying to just dream up the most beautiful life I can, given the new reality I find myself in. Sort of like if I'd been in a tragic accident that limited my mobility... not much use in raging about the injustice. That only hurts me and holds me back from doing all that I can to have the life I want. And I take steps every single day, even if they are small, to move me closer to that bright and beautiful new life.

&#x200B;

I work with attorneys, and lately some manipulation techniques are being used against me.  I realized this week about some of these techniques, and immediately made a plan.  I ended up reviewing the 48 Laws of Power, (this book is banned in many U.S. jails), as it explains all the manipulation techniques to gain POWER.

I decided to quickly make a post, **as this was one of the most important techniques my Covert Narcissist ex used to control me**.  He pretended to be ""dumber"" or inferior to me, and made me look smarter than him.  Covertly, he was playing all the manipulation to control and gain power over me.  It's incredible how some people can play these psychological manipulations and actually marry you in the process !!!   And use you to further their agenda.  Even months after leaving, and while going through the divorce, it was still difficult to see that he never really cared about me... as he was only using me as a tool, as an object for his plans... but literally, I never got to know the person behind the mask.  Just wanted to post the summary of these laws for anyone interested in learning about it, as narcissists and Dark Triads use [The Power and Control Wheel](https://coercivecontrolcollective.org/news/2018/3/12/the-power-and-control-wheel-1) and [Coercive Control](https://coercivecontrolcollective.org/what-is-coercive-control) to keep the victims in place.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred
8224,"OMG! It has taken me forever to finally realize that I have COMPLEX Trauma, and this led me to develop CODEPENDENCY on the narcissist(s). Someone needs to have this to ATTACH to the narcissist in the first place: The Root of the Problem in toxic relationships","**Long story short**:  I grew up with a narcissistic father + a codependent (enabler) mother.   I didn't know that this family system was abnormal, and moved away in my early 20's (subconsciously I wanted to escape without knowing what was wrong).  I had several relationships with narcissists, but I never knew what was narcissism.  I ended up marrying a Covert Narcissist, stayed throughout the abuse trying to fix him / heal him for 6 years, and was discarded a year ago.  I went completely No Contact, filed for a divorce, and since then I've been in therapy trying to become functional again and heal.  My divorce was finalized 5 months ago.

&#x200B;

Okay, I tried to make it as short as possible above.  And the most important part is the **AWARENESS**, as I finally found out that I've been looking for answers in the wrong places.... as the problem was not the narcissist, the problem has been the ""unresolved trauma"" within me all along.  This makes me feel mixed emotions, as I feel sad about this; but also hopeful that at least now I know what the problem is, and now I can start to look for solutions.

So, I was very lucky to find **Tim Fletcher's channel on YouTube**,  Not even sure why we don't talk more about his channel in these communities, but it opened my eyes to the main problem I've been dealing with.  I'm only sharing this here, in case it might help someone else become aware of the root of the problem:

**1)** Complex Trauma always happens in a situation (usually home), where the person with the most power is a narcissist.

**2)** A child with a parent that is a narcissist is SHAMED for having ""needs"" as being selfish... and this causes the child to self-blame, and develop SHAME.

**3)** The core belief growing up is that we are ""not good enough"", and that we need other people's approval, and positive feedback to feel better.

**4)** This creates a Codependent, who will caretake the needs of a narcissist, neglecting oneself.

**Codependency IS an Addiction.**

&#x200B;

Of course, this realization is too painful, and I believe this is why we repress this childhood COMPLEX trauma in order to cope.  After all, we come from a similar family system to the narcissist ... but their trauma was more severe.  With this information, I truly hope to research more and find ways to heal this trauma to be able to have better relationships.

Tim Fletcher:  Highly recommended

8225,Reflecting on my life After becoming aware of the existence of Cluster B Personality Disorders,"**Brief Background**:  I was married to a Cover Narcissist for 6 years, and he left out of the blue and without any explanation 1 year ago.  Soon after, his psychiatrist told me that he had NPD, and that he was undergoing a narcissistic collapse.  She recommended getting away and putting up boundaries.  This has been the darkest year of my life recovering from Narcissistic Abuse, getting a divorce, and then also becoming aware that my own father is a narcissist, which explains the predisposition to subconsciously seek these personality types.

&#x200B;

A year after the discard, I feel better and have regained a sense of normalcy.  I also have gained wisdom about the existence of these personality types, and I've encountered more.  I've gone back to work, and continue attending therapy for PTSD, and trauma... working on myself and rebuilding my self-esteem.  

Still, I started to relive parts of the trauma and the emotional roller coaster 1 year after... especially on dates of anniversaries and stuff like that.  These are residual emotional triggers that also need to be processed with EMDR.  It's been a hell of a year, but definitely, a year that revealed so many things that happened in my life, from childhood to adolescence with my own dad.  I've also become better at detecting people within the spectrum, but it's hard as many people are narcissistic in the United States... the Coverts do good acts of service to receive their Supply/Self Esteem Juice.  All in all, they're manageable once we know how to handle them.... the problem is falling in love with one of them :(

Not sure if other people here also have Intuitive personality types, but I've been having sporadic dreams with my ex-narc and as I sometimes dream about things that will happen in the future, I feel confused if these sporadic dreams are still my mind processing things... if that makes any sense.  

Lastly, I've been in absolute NO CONTACT:  After he left, we only texted 2 weeks later, and he disappeared after I mentioned the divorce.  No text messages, No calls, No looking at his social media, Cut ties with Flying Monkeys.  He's tried to use my siblings by trying ""Reverse Hoover"" on social media, but I also made my close people know about his personality disorder, and to stop bringing messages of what he's doing, etc.  No Contact def works.

8227,Why do I still care?,"I don't like my caring nature.  I would like to stop caring for people, or trying to help others... or even feeling empathy.  It's been almost a year since I left my ex-husband.  The divorce was finalized 4 months ago.  Today I found out that he's not doing that well.. and I hate the fact that I still care for him, and I don't want him to be bad or suffer.  OF COURSE, I would never reach out again.  It's good that his dichotomous thinking (Black & White), painted me ""Black"", so I'm the bad one, while he moves on in his fantasy.   But I hate to have compassion and care in silence from the distance....

And then I thought, well, I don't wish bad for anyone... so it could be the same level of compassion you'd feel for anyone.... and no, it's not the same type of ""compassion""... it feels as if a little child (who cannot help himself), needed help.  That's the situation here.  Sam Vaknin explains it as we take on the role of the ""mother"" in the narcissistic relationship... and leaving is hard because somehow it feels like we abandon a child.  I don't know if this makes any sense.  Just venting here, and wanting to know if after forgiving and getting away, healing the anger, resentment and bitterness...

8244,Feeling upset after n-ex found a new way to contact me/ rant about tech,"It’s been almost 3 years since I left my N ex husband. I started a new relationship and moved to a new state. I got a few attempts from my ex to draw me back into a conversation once the divorce was over but I got through them without responding. I blocked him everywhere I could think of so these were emails and letters by mail to my parents. He has tried to ask my best friend info about me. Even though he’s not on my social media, I make sure to remove any embedded location info if I post a picture in my home.

This year I’ve gotten relaxed, thinking he’s finally gone, too far away to touch me and I can not worry so much. Got a new phone and forgot to block him on it. I just assumed that carried over. Last week he tried FaceTiming me while I was on a date. He left a long message I didn’t listen to and I blocked him. Then today he figures out I made a WhatsApp account a couple of months ago and tries me there. I finally settled on a 1 sentence reply of “I do not want to be in contact.”  I hated to say anything at all but I’m realizing I need to create a record that I do not want his harassment. He of course ignored my wish and responds “I just want to know if you’re with someone.”

What makes him believe he is entitled to that information!? I didn’t respond and blocked him. It makes me nervous as to why he is asking that information though. I know I shouldn’t care but I’m a little afraid of him when he’s angry.

It’s like I can never let my guard down. I know he follows my Spotify account and I can’t block him there. I have to remember to make every playlist private so he doesn’t get the satisfaction of knowing what mood I might be in.

I feel like I need to grieve the idea of having a normal future where he isn’t waiting in the shadows to try and grab me around the ankles and pull me down.

I have had no contact with my mother in 6 years, its been kind of easy since she is in a senior home several hours away. A huge burden off me. After the hurt faded from her, I began to realize that my husband was a narcissist too.

My life is complicated having to take care of a disabled family member, otherwise I'd be gone/divorced. But thankfully he has a short life expectancy due to his own illnesses. After reading Debbie Mirza'a book a few years ago, I couldn't believe how well she described him! One section of the book talked about how Ns hate when you get sick.

Last year, I had a terrible medication reaction, severely impairing my nervous system, one symptom being insomnia for several months. A year later I am still recovering, sleep slowly improving. I was pretty much disabled, too tired to drive or function many times. My N husband was actually having an affair for the first month of my health crisis.

Nex on the other hand never touched them; nada, nothing, never swam in them but maybe twice. Must had been on his list of chores beneath him. While divorcing he was looking for a house and one day came home to tell me, all giddy, he was buying a house with a pool🧐. I asked why, stating you never touched a pool we had? He walked away all disgruntled. So he got a house eventually with a big in ground! My daughter tells he solidly bitches non stop about the pool; the time, money, maintenance, no one comes to use it, how he is going to fill it in with concrete! Sorry so petty of me but it was all I could do not to bust a gut laughing. KARMA, he got a pool as a what he thought was a dig to me (it wasn’t) and it bit him in the ass.

8262,I feel paralyzed,"I've been gone for almost 6 months now. I took our baby girl and left to live with my family. I still have not been able to bring myself to file paperwork. I feel paralyzed. I can't seem to bring myself to taking another step forward. I still hold on to hope, I still feel bad for him, and I'm terrified of losing any amount of custody. All those things keep me from making any kind of decision. I have different people telling me what I need to do to move forward, but I just can't bring myself to do it. It's so frustrating and defeating. 

Do I consult with more lawyers? (Even though I've been given advice, but don't actually take action), seek therapy? (I went to 2 sessions and stopped because it was expensive and I still struggled with moving forward with my situation), or a divorce coach? (Recently heard about this) I just don't know what's going to help me to actually take action.

8264,The abuse has ended!,"I'm sorry if this is cruel, but this is not a post to give you hope. 

My husband and I went through a very abusive time in our relationship. I filed for divorce. My husband claims that this was his rock bottom and a way for him to realize that the behavior was abusive. He has done a complete 180. He has become open and honest with me and his feelings. He has apologized immediately if I became uncomfortable after any statement, and would genuinely ask me to explain why that statement was wrong and help him to correct his behavior. It's only been a month, so we aren't ""out of the woods"", but he/we put effort in every day to ensure our relationship is healthy and supportive for each other and our children. It's become the ideal relationship. My husband has, without persuasion, joined an abusers program and has been working hard in therapy to understand the route cause of his behaviors. He has realized it's been a pattern in each and everyone of his abusive relationships that he has never accepted until now. He has changed his parenting style. He has done everything ""right"".

It pains me to say that I don't think any of that matters. I'm not sure it would matter if the change was guaranteed to be permanent. The resentment I feel toward him for being able to change, but waiting until it suited him to do so is so very palpable. I hope that he continues on this path so that our children, and other relationships in his life can benefit from it. However, for me, it's too late. I used to wish so hard and hold put all hope for this kind of behavior change within this man. I wanted this so badly.

It's very rare that an abusive man takes these actions, and perhaps I am acting selfishly, but I still cannot stay. I cannot fall back in love with him. There is no happy ending.

8269,Overcompensating to “Change”,"So I posted a few days ago about what my husband does to me. It’s obviously emotional abuse. It’s been physical in the past (though not for years). 

I came home from 9 days at my sisters where I saw good couples who support each other and was also supported myself. I had my 8 month old and my BIL helped me with her more than my husband ever has. When I got home I told him I wanted a divorce and we talked. 

He has told me so much that he didn’t know and would die for me and he will change. Now for about 4 days he has been overcompensating and helping so much. Just generally being a different person. And he keeps pushing. Asking me if I want to be with him and trying to out his hands all over me all of a sudden. He’s never really been that way. It’s all so cringe worthy. 

I don’t know why I told him I didn’t know if I wanted to be with him. Nor why I told him we would try counseling (though he’s done nothing to find someone like I asked). Not why I can’t just tell him I don’t want to try.

8272,Feeling hopeless and need help,"I've been trying my hardest to plan to leave my partner this year. Not much is going the way I hoped. 

Job: I have a minimum wage job and have been applying for months for something that earns even a couple dollars more. I have the education and experience, but still am unable to get anything that would allow me to live without seriously struggling. I'm trying to stay away from jobs in areas that would cost a lot to travel and cost of living in those areas are more. 

Support: My family doesn't live in the same state. They either don't want to get involved or don't have the funds to help. I have a few people that have offered help with a down-payment of a rental. But I'm still scared about affording monthly rent. I also think because it's emotional abuse, it's not being taken as seriously as physical. 


Living: Our friends are mutual. So only 1 has offered give us a spare room to stay until we get on our feet. The rest either don't have the room or wouldn't want to get involved. My parents want me to stay in the house or somehow legally force him to leave. I've already checked into this and was told without any proof of abuse, especially physical, it would be extremely difficult. Plus I don't want to stay with him when I end things. Like many people with abusive, controlling, and egotistical tendencies he will not leave even if it makes things amicable. 


Aid: The DV center I've gone to has told me that because he makes so much money, I will not be considered for government assistance until the divorce is finalized. I would have to get an attorney to emergency petition any child or spousal support. 


Child: We share a young daughter together. If he wasn't so dedicated to her I would be planning starting over somewhere far away and affordable. I also feel he's going to argue that he can provide for her more than I can and therefore should have primary custody, when I want 50/50. He's said a lot of things about how women shouldn't get any money if they choose to leave their husbands. A family member of his caught on to our troubles and suggested I should leave everything behind and go start my new life without even my daughter. 

I've been saving to pay for legal help. I need a minimum of $5,000 for a retainer. Plus he's essentially guilted me to not using any of the money he makes by implying that since I've stopped having sex with him, I am a gold digger for using ""his"" money. He insists that if his name is on something, that it is HIS.

8277,Can't make sense of this,"I (35f) have been married to my husband (31m) for 6 years. He is emotionally abusive and physically intimidating. He's never physically hurt me though. 

I am struggling with feeling stuck and hopeless and I can't seem to make sense of what I'm feeling. I'm frustrated with myself and I'm sure friends and family are frustrated with me as well. 

The amount of times I go back and fourth on what to do (leave or stay) is emotionally exhausting and consuming. Some moments I feel like I have all this strength inside of me to finally leave and no longer let someone disrespect and bully me. Moments later I feel intense fear and guilt and decide that maybe I should stay, maybe it can get better, it's not as bad as other people's situations. 

I also go back and fourth on what I want others to do. One moment I'm upset because friends and family don't seem to care or want to help, but then when they do try to help I start to feel like they're being pushy. If talk about lawyers, protective orders, divorce, etc come up l, I feel like I retreat and I'm unsure. I start to feel bad and want to protect him.

8279,I don’t understand,"My husband and I have separated. After a long battle of me trying to fix our relationship, to address the emotional abuse, manipulation and lies, trying to help him through his porn addiction, he left me. 
I’ve been given vague reasons why, that I didn’t support him, that I didn’t help him, that i didn’t put enough effort in because it doesn’t take me as long to clean the house as it does him to do dishes. That we were constantly arguing. None of those reasons I was given 2 months ago have anything to do with his emotional abuse, manipulation, lies and addiction. I’ve been told there are more issues as to why he left me and why he doesn’t see our relationship being fixed. Despite him in the same breathe saying he wants to try again one day, but that he also only sees this as ending in divorce. 

He’s been writing me a letter addressing all the issues he has with me. It’s been two months and I still haven’t seen it. All I get told is that he isn’t ready. 

Last night he told me a few things, like how he’s apparently diagnosed me as being emotionally dependent. I asked him to explain what that means for him. And his examples were because I tell him how I feel about something, that because I have anxiety and panic attacks, because I was crying at the time we were talking. And just basically any time I show any sort of emotion. This doesn’t fit with what I believed emotional dependence is. 

I just feel stuck. There’s apparently all these issues he has with me, things that I’ve done to hurt him etc but I’m not allowed to know what any of it is. If I don’t know what it is, how can I address them and work on them? He also stated that was me being emotional dependent. Which I don’t quite understand either. He’s withholding important information, which I can use to help work on the things he’s had issues with. 

I’ve always had the view that healthy communication, a healthy argument is each side being able to express what their needs are, what their issues are and making the other person aware so that it can be resolved. So that the other person has the opportunity to work on those issues within the relationship or themselves. If they don’t know what they’ve done or how they’ve made the other person feel, how are they suppose to work on it?

8281,Is it a requirement to have high self-esteem to leave a relationship?,"I'll try to make this short. I've been with a man for more than two years and it's been one hell of a ride. We started dating in 2020 and after just one month we made it official. But ever since the beginning I've noticed red flags:

(1) Love-bombing

(2) Talked too much about his ex-wife and divorce

(3) Gaslighting

(4) Non-existent self-awareness

(5) Too defensive during arguments

(6) Victimizes himself too much

(7) Is quick to demand apologies, but when I'm bothered by something, he justifies his behavior

(8) Expects me to suck up some of his behaviors because he was raised in a tough environment

(9) Expects me to trust him no matter what (""because that's what partners do"")

(10) Complains that I'm not committed enough to our relationship, but when I question him he can't point out the exact problem

(11) I've tried to talk to him about future plans, but that conversation went to sh*t because he thinks that I don't understand what being responsible is and he's offended that I don't want to move in to his house

(12) Is awful at communicating

We even went to couple's therapy after a physical incident, but it did not work out. The therapist said that our relationship was based on emotional abuse, but that BOTH of us were taking part. Honestly, I don't think the therapist ever understood my level of frustration.

I know I'm not perfect and that I need to learn to regulate emotions. I've become pretty reactive towards my partner. I've made rookie mistakes because this is my first relationship.  I've seen three different therapists (for individual therapy) and the last one dropped me because she wasn't going to be working in the clinic anymore. I'm planning to search for another therapist right after I finish my master's degree this summer.

The truth is that I'm not as happy as I would like to be. I know this relationship is not good for me, but every time I think about leaving him I get really anxious. It shouldn't be that hard because we don't even live together. We've also had good moments and think that something catastrophic should happen so I can finally call it quits. I just can't stand the thought of him finding someone else and having a better life. I'm fine being alone, but I've been dragging a low self-esteem for ages since I was a teenager and I think I won't be able to find someone to marry and start a family with (I'm in my early 30s).

I thought I was free, that I knew exactly who I was and was living a better life. I thought I was free, until I got that text. The trauma response is horrible. The flash backs, the feeling of wanting to disappear or feeling small and weak in an instant.

I told her I need some time to regain my own identity, then I'll be more able to make a decision for the future. Though my intention has always been to end things when we meet up next week. I did it this way to make the news more bearable for her to take over time, rather than all at once (as usual, me trying to make things easier on HER).

I asked for no contact at this time, but have been coming by our house every couple days while she is at work to let our dogs spend time together. Today, I found a note from her, apologizing, promising me a world of change, and asking for one more chance to bring our happy family back together.

I am very aware that she is future faking, saying what I want to hear so she can keep playing her game with me, and lovebombing to confuse me. But I can also see how people fall for this...

What’s been bothering me lately is that when I’m driving or not completely distracted I start thinking about what him and his family did to me for years and go into this silent rage in my head about how I want to break them down emotionally too but what gets me so angry is that I know I will never stoop down to their level because it would disappoint my family. I’m so angry my wealthy in-laws and ex will live their life knowing they got away with all the abuse and that they will likely tell people lies about how it was my fault. I’m angry they are continuing to do this to other woman. I’m angry I wasted years of my life on this family and kept giving them chances because I didn’t know anyone could really be this evil.

I sent my STBXH a text… and then freaked the heck out. 

He called once. He texted a few times just asking me to please not do this. But he’s been WAY more adult than I thought he would be. He has been agreeing to give me space for a few days… and honoring it. He’s offered to pay for more days at the hotel so we can figure out housing. He’s not demanding to see our son and is letting that happen when we are comfortable. His friend even texted me and said he’s not saying anything bad about me at all, and is heartbroken and completely blaming himself (I mean of course, who else’s fault is this??)

I’m not sure if he’s doing some sort of weird manipulation thing or what. Or if it’s legit. Most of what I’ve read are abusers freaking out, calling names, slandering, basically just lashing out. So I’m just confused. Maybe the explosion will come when he gets served with the divorce papers. 

But I’ve promised myself (and silently my son) to not go back. And I’m not. I can’t. The relief I feel isn’t because he’s being better… it’s because we aren’t walking on eggshells. So I need to remember that.

He’s not even in jail, in the behavioral hospital instead (which I think he really needs). I am struggling with the trauma of the event. We’ve been married for ten years and he put me through the worst experiences of my life. I just don’t know how to get through this one. It’s all over the news and in the paper. Social media. I’m embarrassed. I am so thankful he didn’t get to me, but my heart is breaking. How did it get this bad? I miss the man he was. He’s an alcoholic but the abuse started about 5 years ago.

I'm just now coming to a place where I know he shouldn't be hurting me and that's something only he can make himself stop doing, not me. 

I've not cheated on this man. I've not emptied his 401k... Not saying that there are justifications but the abuse I receive is so unwarranted compared to the instigating incident. Arguing shouldn't result in choking me unconscious. He just abuses the fact that he can physically impose on me because he's stronger.   
I do not want to file a restraining order. I don't want to get a legal paper trail started. We have a baby. I just want to amicably divorce and keep this private. It's embarrassing but also, I care about him and I don't want to damage his reputation. He doesnt even appreciate that about me. He constantly think if I went to the cops they would take his side.

So there we are waking up and he says happy X years for making the biggest mistake of your life.  Fast forward to yesterday and I ask why he said that….he only remembered saying happy anniversary. 

Is this a mind f*ck or something legit not right, this is only one instance where this has happened. When he has said mean things or just stuff in general, he turns around & says he never did, doesn’t know what anyone’s talking about, or gets angry .

Like he said he’s tired of fighting…it took a lot of effort to not laugh and control my facial expressions….he usually rants, curses, etc and spits on me throws stuff, etc. I rarely speak up. I just stay silent and cry (it’s just easier). Only that one weekend I tried to finally speak up & another time in August. 

He has also thrown in my face that he’s not bipolar, personality disorder etc because he “doesn’t lie on the tests that he’s been tested on & he’s already been told he isn’t”

8335,Why can’t I leave? What’s wrong with me?,"I feel like I’m ready to leave. My stuff is packed, in fact it’s all been packed for about 2 months. Just today I had everything set and ready to go I decided I was going to talk with him about how he threatened to put me in jail (I work for him) and depending on his response I would go. The conversation did not go well, no accountability so I decided to go because this feels like the last straw, I can’t take anymore episodes of mistreatment, he’s a true narcissist. 

But I just couldn’t leave. He didn’t even seem to care that I was on my way out the door but still I couldn’t leave and I don’t know why. He is not good for me on any level at all, I don’t want to marry or have kids with him, I can’t see us lasting or him changing. I’m either seriously stressed because of him or very depressed because of him, it’s hard to function sometimes and I’m losing my hair, but why can’t I just go and leave him behind and be at peace?

At this point I feel sorry for him because I have threatened to leave several times now out of exasperation at his utterly cold hearted treatment. I’m his comfort human (anxiety) and he has abandonment issues (mom left because dad was abusive and dad pawned him off to grandma, not to mention his long long list of exes)

After I couldn’t leave I spilled my guts to him about my hurts, he actually listened to me this time and asked me to lay down where he said he didn’t want to break up and we apologized to each other. 

My first relationship I was divorced, second relationship I decided I wanted to break up but stayed 5yrs, started the process of separating and like literally moved right in with this guy. All abusive relationships but this current one takes the cake by far.

Four days ago my soon ex husband (28M) beat me in the head over a switch. He woke me up at 12am being loud with his buddies. It woke up our one year old and i went to take care of her and our 3 year old because i know he will just let them cry. I got them settled and it caused a fight.... Not physical at this point but mostly just stop waking the kids up? At this point i was ready to give up til i noticed he was booting up another game. So i calmly grabbed the switch out of the dock and said go to bed. I didnt break it didnt say he couldnt ever play it. I had no idea such a simple action would change my life. I got to the end of the house to put it in the laundry room and he attacked me. Grabbed me around my forarms and i sunk to the ground to curl up into a fetal position. He caught me in a sleeper hold and proceeded to punch me in the top of my head. Four times ""give me the switch"" four more times. I let it go. In that split second i thought he was going to really injure me. I thought he was going to kill me.....over a fucking console. My daught heard it all. I called the cops and they were baffled. I filed charges and he went to jail. The judge upped it to a class 2 felony and now hes telling his mom he will refuse to plead guilty unless they drop it down to a misdemeanor and guarantee no jail time.

I’m having a tough time with friends and taking sides etc. I don’t want “sides” to be a thing but I really feel like they should know of the physical and emotional abuse. They make him out to be a great human being and that I’m crazy, but he’s not telling them he strangled me or threw a chair at me.  I never called the cops when this happened 2 yrs ago. Then one day I decided I’m done. 

Im paying him close to $2K/mo in alimony for 6 years and not collecting child support. He was such a monster that I’d rather pay him to leave me alone then have to deal with the headache. No one knows of the financials either and if they did it may help define his character. They also don’t know he’s using my money to buy his new girlfriend a new stripper pole. That part just makes me laugh lol. 😂 

Do I just let this go? Call those friends a loss? If they knew the truth I know they’d feel different but I also dont want to ruin his reputation.",yes,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,plausibly,plausibly,yes
8358,Didn't expect escape to be so lonely,"About three months ago I (40F) managed to leave my husband. I'd known I needed to for about a year, after he physically hurt me and then, when he found out I'd told the police, forced me to tell them I'd been drunk and high and made the whole thing up.

The divorce process is going to be protracted and messy, he'll throw everything he can at me, but I was as prepared for that as you can be, I think. I'd got as many of my ducks in a row as I could before I went and I don't \*think\* there's anything he can throw at me that I haven't seen coming. I've got a solicitor who's helping me through the scary stuff and I'm just having to tell myself that he doesn't control me any more, I don't have to do what he wants any more because I no longer have to consider whether he'll make my life miserable into my decisions. My friends and family are being brilliantly supportive.

But. BUT. No one, not one person, knows what went on, knows what it was like. That's partly because I'm ashamed I let myself get into that situation, partly fear that people won't believe me or won't understand, partly (I'll admit it) fear that if he finds out I've told people he'll escalate even further, and partly just that I still see the good in him, so I feel like it would be unfair to ruin his reputation by, erm, telling people the truth about him. I do know all the above is not rational, but I've found it just impossible to tell anyone about it.

And so I'm lonely. Because I can't tell people what \*really\* happened, I find I don't really talk about it at all, at least in any detail. It hurts too much to try and talk about it and have to talk around this great huge secret that's weighing me down. It means that although there's a few people I can talk about the process, legal stuff etc to, there's no one I can cry to. I don't even want to cry about the abuse, necessarily, but because of THE SECRET I can't cry to anyone even just about the fact that I'm getting divorced - I am sad about that, even though it's for the best.

So I'm writing here to get it out, I suppose. He was sometimes violent, but more often he threatened, humiliated and coerced me. I was scared of him. And no one knows. And although I knew there were going to be so many things about this that would be utterly shitty, I didn't realise how lonely it would be.",cannot be inferred,no,yes,yes,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,yes,yes,yes,cannot be inferred
8368,Can't make sense of this,"I (35f) have been married to my husband (31m) for 6 years. He is emotionally abusive and physically intimidating. He's never physically hurt me though. 

I am struggling with feeling stuck and hopeless and I can't seem to make sense of this. I'm frustrated with myself, and I'm sure friends and family are frustrated with me as well. 

The number of times I go back and forth on what to do (leave or stay) is emotionally exhausting and consuming. Some moments, I feel like I have all this strength inside of me to finally leave and no longer let someone disrespect and bully me. Moments later, I feel intense fear and guilt and decide that maybe I should stay. Maybe it can get better. It's not as bad as other people's situations. 

I also go back and forth on what I want others to do. One moment, I'm upset because friends and family don't seem to care or want to help, but then when they do try to help, I start to feel like they're being pushy. If talk about lawyers, protective orders, divorce, etc come up l, I feel like I retreat, and I'm unsure. I start to feel bad and want to protect him. I understand that this must be extremely frustrating for my friends and family.

8369,Co-Parenting and Outing the Abuser,"When I first got divorced (5 years ago), I tried to mitigate the difficulties by not talking much about the violence or abuse. I wanted coparenting to work and to try to support the relationship of the kids to their other parent, who had been violent with me and the oldest (of 2). 

&#x200B;

So, now, the other parent has re-engaged the legal process to change custody and I've been asked to answer questions like, ""Do you feel you've been treated well?"" ""What's a typical argument like?"" ""Has your partner ever been violent?"" I feel the need to tell the truth - but I also fear that doing so will create reprisals. The truth is that no matter how hard I work (or have worked or will work) to keep things calm, this person isn't acknowledging their behaviors and some of it is continuing. To me, it's a clear sign of a problem that I feel unable to truthfully talk about what happened for fear of making them mad and making it harder to work together. It just stinks (as someone who wants to work together and coparent, etc).

8373,They let him out a day after he tried to kill me,"On the 16th, I (25f) called the police on my husband (28f). He strangled me three times. He came home at 5 in the morning and I asked him why? He got very angry and strangled me the once. I ran upstairs and closed the door. He strangled me two more times. The last time he put pinched my nose while choking me. My 5 year old was sleeping in the next room. 

They gave this man a $5000 or $500 cash. He was out the next day. His family lives across the street from me, a block away, he himself is now living 5 blocks away.

The victims advocate is useless and so is pretrial services.

I was contact today so they couldn’t do a civil assist so he could get the rest of his things from my home. I haven’t been staying there, I’ve been at my moms. I cannot see him. I cannot hear his name. I cannot live in that neighborhood any longer. I don’t even think I could make it through a trial. I just physically can’t and I feel like I will break. 

He is my husband. I don’t feel bad that I called the cops on him but I don’t want ANYTHING to do with him. Im thinking about how even when I file my divorce papers I’ll have to see him at the status conference and I’m trying to see if there’s a way for me to avoid this. 

No, this isn’t the first time he’s strangled me. He actually wasn’t much for physical violence such as punching etc. he would just strangle me. But I cannot do this. I just want to move on. I changed my number,
I’m attempting to move apartments, I’m moving my kid schools. I just want to disappear where he cannot find me. I have no social media and nobody in my inner circle would give my location up so it can be done.

8374,The start of physical abuse?,"My husband and I had a fight this morning. I asked him why he shut his phone down when I came close to give him a kiss goodbye. Prompted him shouting at me that I'm always insecure. Told me he wants a divorce which he always does when we fight. Threw his ring at me. I told him I wanted to talk and he said I'm done with you and slapped me across the face. Each time we fight he gets more and more mad. He's choked me before when I accused him of messaging a girl that I had seen nudes on his phone before. 

It just progressively worse. I feel like when we fight he shuts me out and constantly says he wants a divorce. When we don't fight, he's sweet and thoughtful and does a lot for the home. I've been making good money so I suggested him to leave his job to finally finish his associate degree while we can afford it. Ever since then things have just gotten worse. We made it through Covid even though we both were working. I always have to give in during a fight because I don't like being mad at each other and I hate how I have to beg. Like why do I have to constantly fight to keep this relationship going? Without me he wouldn't have a house, all these wonderful things. I have mental health issues and been dealing with my grandmother dying recently. I've been struggling to find happiness and insecure with myself. I have been working out and trying to take care of myself but also make our relationship better. 

It was a year ago that he had choked me. And this morning when he slapped me. I hate the emotional turmoil he puts me in everytime he wants a divorce. I just dont know what to do and I feel like it's only going to get worse. I have no support system because I don't want to tarnish his name by telling people. But after this morning I deleted and blocked him from snapchat and Instagram and took money from our joint account. 

I want to leave him because I'm sick of everything but how do you throw away 7 years of being together - almost 2 of being married.

My son told me he feels calmer when my husband and I are not in the house at the same time because he doesn’t have to worry about us fighting.

8386,Will I Always Get Stuck With Abusive Men?,"I had a rough childhood. Shitty stuff happened to me and my siblings. My mom has narcissist tendencies. She loves to criticize, put down and has even told me once I should commit suicide bc I wouldn't be missed. In my early 20's I started dating. My self-esteem was very low. My mom's put downs took a toll on me. I could find a man to date me or someone to have sex with but the only men that stuck around that I got into a long-term relationships with treated me poorly. I got emotionally  abused, which I was used to from my mom and was physically abused as well.

 I kept this cycle going. Met someone. Missed red flags. Get abused. Stay too long when I needed to leave. Finally get out.

My last relationship lasted 12 years. I got pregnant right after we started dating. We married.  I had a baby boy. He was not a good dad, husband or provider. He was very verbally abusive which eventually turned in physical abuse. I stayed in this miserable existence because I did want my child to have a broken family because that's what a divorce does. Breaks up families. Looking back, divorce is better than a child living in a home where they are witnessing their mother be called names, yelled at and hit.our son is now 11. I have separated from my husband and even though he begs for another chance and that he will change I don't buy it. He doesn't want to change or he would have over this past 12 years.

I have been going to therapy to figure out how I ended up in all these shitty relationships. I have worked a lot on learning to love myself and my self-esteem is much higher. It think as we get older we see ourselves in a much more positive light. I read self help books and go to a domestic violence surviors group weekly.

I think I am nothing like the woman I wad in my 20s. Therapy has helped me, my support group and I think on my 40s I have more self love, self acceptance and higher self-esteem. I don't think I am doomed to always being struck in toxic relationships.

He doesn’t overtly abuse us but neglects us, emotionally abused and controls most things and I believe has been sabotaging our car, washing machine, kitchen sink and more. He even intentionally sabotaged my support dogs training and she ended up needing to be euthanized which shattered my heart. He has lied and kept us (he lives away) living in a health hazard while I said we desperately need it fixed - he insisted I was wrong and there was no problem until I abruptly hired help (against his wishes!) and I now have proof.

Lies and cruelty. Only gives us the minimum to function and it seems he sets me up to fail and rely upon him to save the day. He makes everyone around us believe he is doing everything for us yet it’s a charade. He keeps dangling a family together happy future but we’ve rarely lived together as he prefers to make top dollar on the road. He is a genius, perfectionist and has no fear. I suspect lots of affairs with men (but I don’t really even care about that much) and that he wants to kill me to avoid divorce since that would make him look bad (we recently discovered I’m autistic and physically disabled) and he would have to maybe pay alimony.

8405,The brainwashing.,"Despite having left a while ago, I am so susceptible to any invalidation: gaslighting from him.

I am filing for divorce this week. I cannot go no contact as we have a son we are sharing custody of.
Yes, I restrict any interactions with him.
I rarely see him. My parents help out with pickups/drop off so I can limit seeing him.

That’s not the point.
The point is: when he does slip in a disparaging comment or casually rewrites history- I question myself immensely. It’s better, as in my resiliency is faster than it used to be. But it still makes me question my sanity, my values, my self awareness. I spiral into despair and begin feeling evil. Logic isn’t relevant here. I don’t need a pep talk.
Those of you who have experienced this will understand what I mean by IT IS NOT LOGICAL. But neither are people. Not entirely. 

How do y’all handle the reality distorting? It feels like he possesses me. I’m intelligent, highly educated, have had a successful career and am fucking tough. But I cannot figure this out.

My therapist encourages me to use a custody app for all communications but this will take time. As I said, I’m only just filing for divorce now.

8406,Narc Husband (mostly) Admitted to It.,"I left my husband one month ago - moved out of the house while he was out of town. He was deeply hurt by my decision to leave, but I know his rage was at the fact that he had no control over me or the process. 

Last Wednesday he sent me a 2.5 page single-spaced PDF telling me all about his lifelong deep desire to control other people, and about how he manipulated and domineered me for nearly a decade.  He admitted to being a nihilistic, solipsistic egomaniac, dancing around the obvious narcissistic truth. 

He says he recognizes the pattern and wants to change. I know that he thinks he is capable of this change because his narcissism fuels his desire to be special. But deep down he still sees every other human as an NPC in his own personal game. 

And yet, no where in that letter is there an apology, or any acknowledgement or empathy for the obvious pain and hurt that led me to leave, or any understanding that I have every reason to never see him again. The next day, he texted me to ask to hang out, adding that he hopes when my temporary housing situation is over in June that I move back in with him. 

What was the point of sending me that letter? What’s the motive? What legal ramifications are there for me having that letter as we move towards divorce?

8410,Just like a boomerang...,"They always come back.

I'm about to collect an inheritance from a family member (I would rather have the person than the money, but the money will change the course of my life). So now he's calling and saying he's ""worried about"" us and other things that are untrue. I know in hopes that I'll take him back and let him spend my money.

2 years on, with hardly any contact and nearly no visitation with his kids (two, for anyone curious. Two times he's seen his kids for a couple of hours each time), he has shown back up. He's trying to walk the line of ""oh it's been so hard on me"" and ""look how much I've changed"". Guys, he hasn't changed. What he eats, drinks, or smokes do NOT count as changes when he's the same self-centered energy vampire he's ever been. What's more, he could have a personality transplant and it STILL wouldn't be enough for me to forgive all the ways he damaged my kids and myself. I'm trying to play just nice enough to keep him from doing one dumb thing that would cause me a serious financial injury. So I'm having to pretend to be empathetic to his sniveling.

I'm staying tough by imagining his face when he gets served divorce papers in just a very few short weeks.

8412,Is there ever a way of getting back to normal after divorcing a narc?,"I don't believe in love anymore the way that I used to. I can't see myself trusting anyone ever again. I feel completely unlovable and like there's something wrong with me that caused the abuse to happen to me especially watching how well he's treating the new supply. Now, I don't plan on dating for years. I have a lot of healing to do, I'm aware of that. I just wonder if I'm permanently broken now. I used to dream of having a happy family and I unknowingly married my father and repeated my parents dynamic. My mother never dated again. She actually went a bit insane after my dad discarded her and I understand her so much now. I can't even look at myself in the mirror anymore and don't see how anyone would want to be with me ever. I feel used, like I was just a toy. He successfully broke me. I feel like a shell of my former self. It's so funny because younger me would be so disappointed to be watching me breaking down over a man but here I am. I lost myself completely in this relationship. It angers me that he gets to leave and do what he wants meanwhile I'm going to have to parent on my own and pick up all the pieces he left me with. I worry I'm never going to find a normal and that I'm always just going to feel this way. I feel so empty. Sometimes just getting up in the morning is a struggle. I feel hopeless and worry I'm never going to find myself again. I just want to feel secure in myself and confident again like I used to.

8413,For those that have kids with their Nex but are now divorced…,"Backstory: I’ve known something was off from the beginning but became immediately trauma-bonded. Despite my instinct to not marry him, he did possess a lot of qualities I thought I wouldn’t get elsewhere (or was ‘done’ hunting for), so we got married and now have 2 kids. 

Recently: Last year I sought out a therapist who does ‘Mother Wound’ work.  It was hugely impactful and we’ve now moved into more of my day to day issues.  I could not for the life of me pinpoint why I was so irritable and felt completely fried and frazzled in my body, despite being on anti-anxiety meds that work when things are good, but the state that I always revert to is this frazzled, grumpy mess. 

Therapy Eye Opener: it’s HIM! My anxiety has a first name and after my therapist blew the doors wide open I did a deep, deep dive into educating myself.  

Statement: I am trauma-bonded to my covert narcissist husband who is coercively controlling.  

^this is hugely validating - I wish I hadn’t been blind all these years

Question: after your veil was lifted how long did it take you to: 
- File a separation agreement? 
- To prepare your children? 
- To acquire some finances (I have none, because I haven’t worked in 10 years)? 
- Did you make your nex aware ahead of time or did you just end it?

Saturday I slipped and told him (while intoxicated) that being around him too much makes me sick to my stomach. He got mad. Went to his room and was yelling and cussing. Scared our daughter. I called the police because she wanted me too and we left. 

We hung out at a friend's house for a few hours and came home for bedtime prep which is when the cops showed up.

He has not talked to either of us since Saturday night. He comes into my room in the morning before he goes to work, leans over me, and tells our daughter he loves her. But no other interaction with her (or me, besides aggressive text) since SATURDAY.

I went in his room last night (it still has a lot of our daughter's things) and found his wedding ring on his couch. I don't know why that made me so sad.

8421,"I (30F) cheated on my husband (27M), and now I suspect he's seeing another woman","He knows I cheated.
We didn't separate and I begged him to not divorce and let me fix this.
He agreed but his behavior since my confession has basically been one of indifference. Like I wrote on my last post, I do my best to be the best wife he  could ask for: I cook his favorite foods, get him gifts, screw his brains out every night.

He just smiles and thanks me. He acts kind and never yells at me, but I feel his icy indifference under that mask of courtesy.
Two weeks ago he started coming home late. Very late. And when he does he just goes to bed. 
I asked him what's going on, and he told me in the kindest way possible that it's not my business.

I call him when he stays out and he picked up only once. I heard a woman laughing in the background. I am starting to think he is cheating back on me.
It fucking hurts. If he told me at least I would do my best to stomach it, I deserve this after all. But he won't tell me, he just shuts me out.
A common friend told me she spotted him in a car with a woman she didn't recognize and this felt like a stab in the heart. She said she couldn't describe her exactly because she wore big sunglasses, but she recognized my husband because of his particular taste in neckties.
They were talking, but my friend said that from their position it looked like they were holding their hands or one of them was touching the other's lap.

I don't know what to do. If he is having an affair I deserve it, but I need to know. The uncertainty is killing me.
Should I confront him? Should I try to find out more?

8424,"We re breaking up, but he only wants to talk around his family","This is BECAUSE of his family.

It’s been one month since his (33) family began ostracizing me (f29). Four weeks ago I had gone on my first date during our divorce process. He got upset about it and abruptly took our baby to his parents place at 8:30pm (baby’s bedtime), told them all about my sex life, that I wanted a dildo, had them yell and swear at me. 

Since then his abuse had turned physical. On one occasion, he grabbed my wrist, twisted, and pulled me down to the floor while he was holding our baby ( I made a report and the police have turned my case over to the DA). Finally, after his mom called *me* psychotic and yelled at my mom about how exhausting it all was, we have separated.

My family has had to now rally behind me. They are breaking their lease to move into a new place with my baby and I. Getting them to understand the gravity of this situation was a journey. 

Today, I texted him to ask if we could finally speak in person. He said that he needed a witness, and I agreed on the condition that it could be a person outside of both our families. He refused and said that it had to be a family member of his. He then said that he’s no longer comfortable with the idea of conversing in person. I’m so shocked at how disagreeable he’s been through this. He is attached at the hip to his mom, sister, and dad and it’s kind of gross.

Tldr: husband and I are going through divorce. After he physically hurt me two weeks ago, he now refuses to talk in person without his mom or dad around.

8425,Boyfriend gets mad after I said no sex,"I F29 have been dating a guy M42 for a while now. He is in the middle of divorce proceedings. We were always long distance in the same country but last year I also moved countries. He visits often but in January this year I asked for a break until his divorce is finalised. I said we could still meet whenever he was in town and chat over the phone from time to time because it’s not like I don’t love him. I did say that we won’t be having sex in this period. He went ballistic and said he likes sex and he isn’t ashamed of it and he sees me only once in a few months so of course he will want it and that by taking it away I’m forcing him to probably see others for his sexual gratification. He said this in one of his last messages: I want to really bend to your needs but here I don't want to walk the fine line of what to do and what not to do....when I see you I don't know what will happen and I don't want sex or anything to be something which is being performed under compulsion....here I am planning dinners etc but what is the point....
So I don’t know if I’m overthinking or over reacting. Need help figuring it out otherwise I’m losing my mind. Is wanting to stay in touch only possible when you are physically together as well? I would love to be with him but only when the divorce is through cause otherwise I feel like I’m getting the shorter end of the bargain since he s been getting this divorce for quite some time now. 
To add to it, this conversation happened after I spiralled out and had a bad panic attack a few nights ago. He knew about it and I still chose to be honest about what I need from him since he kept pestering me to be honest with him and tell him what was on my mind. His reaction seemed to only give me more pain.

8428,(24f) I think my husband (25m) is falling out of love with me,"I’ll be honest, I gained some weight from a medication I went on due to health problems. I’m now off this medication and working on losing weight again. This is where our issues started because he doesn’t like my weight. 


We’ve been together for 7 years. Married for 2. 
The compliments recently stopped and the physical affection slowly did too. I could send him  random selfie and instead of hyping me up, he said “cute.”


He posts blogs about relationships advice and it makes him sound so romantic , but he doesn’t do that for me. He said men should hold the door for women, which he used to do for me. But now he walks first through any door. He doesn’t hold me like he used to, he only cuddles me before bed. He said that it makes sense because relationship therapists are all divorced anyway. 

I tried talking to him and expressing that I need more reassurance from him. He kind of brushed it off. I revisit the topic once again while making dinner and he ignored me. I started crying and he told me to get my tears away from his food, he’ll kiss me and compliment me when he feels like it. He also threw the remote and said I’m complaining too much. 

Am I being too desperate? I don’t know what to do at this point or even if I can have a conversation about it.

8431,My family hates my boyfriend and wants me to break up with him.,"Hey all

I (24F) have been with this guy (24M) for about 9 months. But we only have been officially dating for about 3 months. But my family HATES him. 

One of the main factors is that he is living with his mom and best friend. He pays rent to his mother and works a minimum wage job. He has 1 DUI and is working on probation. 

He does work and pay his bills but my family doesn’t believe we are on the same path. Me having a degree and working a corporate job. 

I really do love him and he has been very kind to me with some fights here and there. I think his family dynamic is a bit different than my family. 

I told my mom that money isn’t everything to me and we could make ends meet but she has been divorced twice and told me she doesn’t want me to go down that road. She even keeps trying to find guys for me to talk to while I am in this relationship. They talk down to him a lot calling him fat and ugly (not to his face). Just low blows. 

The only time I can ever think of them being happy in my relationship was people they chose me to date. Like a family friend or something. Its always been farmer dudes and Texan dudes. Its never really been my type and those relationships always failed. My mom would even blame me for the relationship failing when it was forced on me. 

But when it comes to all of the relationships I have wanted they always made fun of them in some way. But with this guy he does have a DUI and does not really have life goals. 

I don’t know if my mom is projecting or if she has a right to be concerned. I am clouded by love right now and don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR : my mom and dad want me to break up with my boyfriend because he doesn’t have a good enough job or goal.

UPDATE 2: I am updating the post and not just commenting but if you want the first update its down there. 

Anyways so he has been trying to contact me and he basically blew up my phone with texts saying that I have no friends and my family is using me. That he is the only one who cares about me. While its true I am introverted and keep to myself it was very hurtful to here coming out of someones mouth that I am alone. We are still broken up and I have blocked him because he called me 11 times in an hour. 🫠",irrelevant,no,plausibly,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,,cannot be inferred,cannot be inferred,plausibly,plausibly,,,,
